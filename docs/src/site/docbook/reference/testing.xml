  <title>Unit Testing</title>

  <para>Just as with other application styles, it is extremely important to
  unit test any code written as part of a batch job as well. The Spring core
  documentation covers how to unit and integration test with Spring in great
  detail, so it won't be repeated here. It is important, however, to think
  about how to 'end to end' test a batch job, which is what this chapter will
  focus on.</para>

  <section>
    <title>End To End Testing Batch Jobs</title>

    <para>'End To End' testing can be defined as testing the complete run of a
    batch job from beginning to end. If the job reads from a file, then writes
    into the database, this type of testing ensures that any preconditions are
    met (reference data, correct file, etc) and then runs the job, verifying
    afterwards that all records that should be in the database are present and
    correct. Below is an example from one of the Spring Batch sample jobs, the
    'fixedLengthImportJob'. It reads from a flat file (in fixed length format)
    and loads the records into the database. The following unit test code
    assures it processes correctly:</para>

    <programlisting>  //fixed-length file is expected on input
  protected void validatePreConditions() throws Exception{
    BufferedReader reader = null;
    reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileLocator.getFile()));
    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
      assertEquals (LINE_LENGTH, line.length());
    }
  }

  //Check that records have been correctly written to database
  protected void validatePostConditions() throws Exception {

  inputSource.open(new ExecutionContext());

  jdbcTemplate.query("SELECT ID, ISIN, QUANTITY, PRICE, CUSTOMER FROM trade ORDER BY id", 
       new RowCallbackHandler() {

    public void processRow(ResultSet rs) throws SQLException {
      Trade trade;
      try {
        trade = (Trade)inputSource.read();
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
        throw new IllegalStateException(e.getMessage());
      }
      assertEquals(trade.getIsin(), rs.getString(2));
      assertEquals(trade.getQuantity(),rs.getLong(3));
      assertEquals(trade.getPrice(), rs.getBigDecimal(4));
      assertEquals(trade.getCustomer(), rs.getString(5));
    }});
    
    assertNull(inputSource.read());
  }</programlisting>

    <para>In the first method, <methodname>validatePreConditions</methodname>,
    the input file is checked to ensure it is correctly formatted. Because it
    is common to add extra lines to the file to test additional use cases,
    this test ensures that the fixed length lines are the length they should
    be. If they are not, it is much preferred to fail in this phase, rather
    than the job (correctly) failing during the run and causing needless
    debugging.</para>

    <para>In the second method, validatePostconditions, the database is
    checked to ensure all data has been written correctly. This is arguably
    the most important part of the test. In this case, it reads one line from
    the file, and one row from the database, and checks each column one by one
    for accuracy. It's important to not hard-code the data that should be
    present in the database into the test class. Instead, use the input file
    (bypassing the job) to check the output. This allows you to quickly add
    additional test cases to your file without having to add them to code. The
    same would be true for database to database jobs, or database to file
    jobs. It is preferable to be able to add additional rows to the database
    input without having to add them to the hard coded list in the test
    class.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Extending Unit Test frameworks</title>

    <para>Because most unit testing of complete batch jobs will take place in
    the development environment (i.e. eclipse) it's important to be able to
    launch these tests in the same way you would launch any unit test. In the
    following examples JUnit 3.8 will be used, but any testing framework could
    be substituted. The Spring Batch samples contain many 'sample jobs' that
    are unit tested using this technique. The most important step is being
    able to launch the job within a unit test. This requires the use of the
    <classname>JobLauncher</classname> interface that is discussed in chapters
    2 and 4. A <classname>Job</classname> and
    <classname>JobLauncher</classname> must be obtained from an
    <classname>ApplicationContext</classname>, and then launched. The
    following abstract class from Spring Batch Samples illustrates
    this:</para>

    <programlisting>  public abstract class AbstractBatchLauncherTests extends
                        AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTests {

    JobLauncher launcher;
    private Job job;
    private JobParameters jobParameters = new JobParameters();

    public AbstractBatchLauncherTests() {
      setDependencyCheck(false);
    }

    /*
    * @see org.springframework.test.AbstractSingleSpringContextTests#getConfigLocations()
    */ 
    protected String[] getConfigLocations() {
      return new String[] { ClassUtils.addResourcePathToPackagePath(getClass(), 
                            ClassUtils.getShortName(getClass()) + "-context.xml") };
    }

    public void testLaunchJob() throws Exception {
      launcher.run(job, jobParameters);
    }

    public void setLauncher(JobLauncher bootstrap) {
      this.launcher = bootstrap;
    }

    public void setJob(Job job) {
      this.job = job;
    }
}</programlisting>

    <para>The Spring Test class
    <classname>AbstractDependencyInjectionSpringContextTests</classname> is
    extended to allow for context loading, autowiring, etc. Only two classes
    are needed: The Job to be run, and the JobLauncher to run it. Empty
    <classname>JobParameters</classname> are used in the example above.
    However, if the job requires specific parameters they could be coded in
    subclasses with an abstract method, or using a factory bean in the
    <classname>ApplicationContext</classname> for testing purposes. Because
    none of the sample jobs require this, an empty
    <classname>JobParameters</classname> is used. One simple JUnit test case
    is present in the file, which actually launches the job. If any exceptions
    are thrown or assertions fail, it will act the same way as any other unit
    test and display as a failed test due to errors or assertion failure.
    Because of the best practice for validation mentioned earlier in the
    chapter, this class is extended further to allow for separate validation
    before and after the job is run:</para>

    <programlisting>  public abstract class AbstractValidatingBatchLauncherTests extends AbstractBatchLauncherTests {

    public void testLaunchJob() throws Exception {
      validatePreConditions();
      super.testLaunchJob();
      validatePostConditions();
    }

  /**
  * Make sure input data meets expectations
  */
  protected void validatePreConditions() throws Exception {}

  /**
  * Make sure job did what it was expected to do.
  */
  protected abstract void validatePostConditions() throws Exception;

}
</programlisting>

    <para>In the class above, the <methodname>testLaunchJob</methodname>
    method is overridden to call the two abstract methods for validation.
    Before actually running the job,
    <methodname>validatePreConditions</methodname> is called (it should be
    noted that it's not required), and then after the job completes
    successfully, <methodname>validatePostConidtions</methodname> is
    called.</para>
