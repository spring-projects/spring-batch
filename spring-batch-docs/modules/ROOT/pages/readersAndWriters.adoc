All batch processing can be described in its most simple form as reading in large amounts
of data, performing some type of calculation or transformation, and writing the result
out. Spring Batch provides three key interfaces to help perform bulk reading and writing:
`ItemReader`, `ItemProcessor`, and `ItemWriter`.
