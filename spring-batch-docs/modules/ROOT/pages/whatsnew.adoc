== What's New in Spring Batch 5.1

Spring Batch 5.1 introduces the following features:

* <<dependencies-upgrade>>
* <<virtual-threads-support>>
* <<memory-management-improvement-jpaitemwriter>>
* <<new-synchronized-decorators>>

[[dependencies-upgrade]]
=== Dependencies upgrade

In this release, the Spring dependencies are updated to the following versions:

* Spring Framework 6.1.0-M2
* Spring Integration 6.2.0-M1
* Spring Data 3.2.0-M1
* Spring LDAP 3.2.0-M1
* Micrometer 1.12.0-M1

[[virtual-threads-support]]
=== Virtual Threads support

Embracing JDK 21 LTS is one of the main themes for Spring Batch 5.1, especially the support of
virtual threads from Project Loom. In this release, virtual threads can be used in all areas of the
framework, like running a concurrent step with virtual threads or launching multiple steps in parallel
using virtual threads.

Thanks to the well designed separation of concerns in Spring Batch, threads are not managed directly. Thread
management is rather delegated to `TaskExecutor` implementations from Spring Framework. This programming-to-interface
approach allows you to switch between `TaskExecutor` implementations in a transparent and a flexible way.

In Spring Framework 6.1, a new `TaskExecutor` implementation based on virtual threads has been introduced, which is the
`VirtualThreadTaskExecutor`. This `TaskExecutor` can be used in Spring Batch wherever a `TaskExecutor` is required.

[[memory-management-improvement-jpaitemwriter]]
=== Memory management improvement in the JpaItemWriter

When using the `JpaItemWriter`, the JPA persistence context can quickly grow when the chunk size
is large enough. This might lead to `OutOfMemoryError` errors if not cleared appropriately in a timely manner.

In this release, a new option named `clearPersistenceContext` has been introduced in the `JpaItemWriter`
to clear the persistence context after writing each chunk of items. This option improves the memory management
of chunk-oriented steps dealing with large amounts of data and big chunk sizes.

[[new-synchronized-decorators]]
=== New synchronized decorators for item readers and writers

Up to version 5.0, Spring Batch provided two decorators `SynchronizedItemStreamReader` and `SynchronizedItemStreamWriter`
to synchronize thread access to `ItemStreamReader#read` and `ItemStreamWriter#write`. Those decorators are useful when
using non thread-safe item streams in multi-threaded steps.

While those decorators work with `ItemStream` implementations, they are not usable with non-item streams. For example,
those decorators cannot be used to synchronize access to `ListItemReader#read` or `KafkaItemWriter#write`.

For users convenience, this release introduces new decorators for non-item streams as well. With this new feature, all
item readers and writers in Spring Batch can now be synchronized without having to write custom decorators.
