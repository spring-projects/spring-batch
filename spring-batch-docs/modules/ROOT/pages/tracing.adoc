= Tracing

As of version 5, Spring Batch provides tracing through Micrometer's `Observation` API. By default, tracing is enabled
when using `@EnableBatchProcessing`. Spring Batch will create a trace for each job execution and a span for each
step execution.

If you do not use `EnableBatchProcessing`, you need to register a `BatchObservabilityBeanPostProcessor` in your
application context, which will automatically setup Micrometer's observability in your jobs and steps beans.
