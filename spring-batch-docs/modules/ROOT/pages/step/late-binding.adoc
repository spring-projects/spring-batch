= Late Binding of `Job` and `Step` Attributes

Both the XML and flat file examples shown earlier use the Spring `Resource` abstraction
to obtain a file. This works because `Resource` has a `getFile` method that returns a
`java.io.File`. You can configure both XML and flat file resources by using standard Spring
constructs:

Java::

The following example shows late binding in Java:
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public FlatFileItemReader flatFileItemReader() {
	FlatFileItemReader<Foo> reader = new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<Foo>()
			.name("flatFileItemReader")
			.resource(new FileSystemResource("file://outputs/file.txt"))
			...
}
----

XML::

The following example shows late binding in XML:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="flatFileItemReader"
      class="org.springframework.batch.item.file.FlatFileItemReader">
    <property name="resource"
              value="file://outputs/file.txt" />
</bean>
----

====




The preceding `Resource` loads the file from the specified file system location. Note
that absolute locations have to start with a double slash (`//`). In most Spring
applications, this solution is good enough, because the names of these resources are
known at compile time. However, in batch scenarios, the file name may need to be
determined at runtime as a parameter to the job. This can be solved using `-D` parameters
to read a system property.

The following shows how to read a file name from a property in Java:

@Bean
public FlatFileItemReader flatFileItemReader(@Value("${input.file.name}") String name) {
	return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<Foo>()
			.name("flatFileItemReader")
			.resource(new FileSystemResource(name))
			...
}

<bean id="flatFileItemReader"
      class="org.springframework.batch.item.file.FlatFileItemReader">
    <property name="resource" value="${input.file.name}" />
</bean>
----

All that would be required for this solution to work would be a system argument (such as
`-Dinput.file.name="file://outputs/file.txt"`).

NOTE: Although you can use a `PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer` here, it is not
necessary if the system property is always set because the `ResourceEditor` in Spring
already filters and does placeholder replacement on system properties.

Often, in a batch setting, it is preferable to parameterize the file name in the
`JobParameters` of the job (instead of through system properties) and access them that
way. To accomplish this, Spring Batch allows for the late binding of various `Job` and
`Step` attributes.

You can access both the `JobExecution` and `StepExecution` level `ExecutionContext` in
the same way.

			.resource(new FileSystemResource(name))
			...
}

public FlatFileItemReader flatFileItemReader(@Value("#{stepExecutionContext['input.file.name']}") String name) {

			.name("flatFileItemReader")
			.resource(new FileSystemResource(name))
			...
}
----

XML::

The following example shows how to access the `ExecutionContext` in XML:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="flatFileItemReader" scope="step"
      class="org.springframework.batch.item.file.FlatFileItemReader">
    <property name="resource" value="#{jobExecutionContext['input.file.name']}" />

</bean>
----

NOTE: Any bean that uses late binding must be declared with `scope="step"`. See
xref:step/late-binding.adoc#step-scope[Step Scope] for more information.
A `Step` bean should not be step-scoped. If late binding is needed in a step
definition, the components of that step (tasklet, item reader or writer, and so on)
are the ones that should be scoped instead.

NOTE: If you use Spring 3.0 (or above), the expressions in step-scoped beans are in the
Spring Expression Language, a powerful general purpose language with many interesting
features. To provide backward compatibility, if Spring Batch detects the presence of
older versions of Spring, it uses a native expression language that is less powerful and
that has slightly different parsing rules. The main difference is that the map keys in
the example above do not need to be quoted with Spring 2.5, but the quotes are mandatory
in Spring 3.0.
// TODO Where is that older language described? It'd be good to have a link to it here.
// Also, given that we are up to version 5 of Spring, should we still be talking about
// things from before version 3? (In other words, we should provide a link or drop the
// whole thing.)

[[step-scope]]
== Step Scope

All of the late binding examples shown earlier have a scope of `step` declared on the
bean definition.

</bean>

Using a scope of `Step` is required to use late binding, because the bean cannot
actually be instantiated until the `Step` starts, to let the attributes be found.
Because it is not part of the Spring container by default, the scope must be added
explicitly, by using the `batch` namespace, by including a bean definition explicitly
for the `StepScope`, or by using the `@EnableBatchProcessing` annotation. Use only one of
those methods.  The following example uses the `batch` namespace:

[source, xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:batch="http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="...">
<batch:job .../>
...
</beans>
----

The following example includes the bean definition explicitly:

[source, xml]
----
<bean class="org.springframework.batch.core.scope.StepScope" />
----

[[job-scope]]
== Job Scope

`Job` scope, introduced in Spring Batch 3.0, is similar to `Step` scope in configuration
but is a scope for the `Job` context, so that there is only one instance of such a bean
per running job. Additionally, support is provided for late binding of references
accessible from the `JobContext` by using `#{..}` placeholders. Using this feature, you can pull bean
properties from the job or job execution context and the job parameters.

----
<bean id="..." class="..." scope="job">
    <property name="name" value="#{jobExecutionContext['input.name']}.txt" />

====



Because it is not part of the Spring container by default, the scope must be added
explicitly, by using the `batch` namespace, by including a bean definition explicitly for
the JobScope, or by using the `@EnableBatchProcessing` annotation (choose only one approach).
The following example uses the `batch` namespace:

[source, xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		  xmlns:batch="http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch"
		  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		  xsi:schemaLocation="...">

<batch:job .../>
...
</beans>
----

The following example includes a bean that explicitly defines the `JobScope`:

[source, xml]
----
<bean class="org.springframework.batch.core.scope.JobScope" />
----

NOTE: There are some practical limitations of using job-scoped beans in multi-threaded
or partitioned steps. Spring Batch does not control the threads spawned in these
use cases, so it is not possible to set them up correctly to use such beans. Hence,
we do not recommend using job-scoped beans in multi-threaded or partitioned steps.

[[scoping-item-streams]]
== Scoping `ItemStream` components

When using the Java configuration style to define job or step scoped `ItemStream` beans,
the return type of the bean definition method should be at least `ItemStream`. This is required
so that Spring Batch correctly creates a proxy that implements this interface, and therefore
honors its contract by calling `open`, `update` and `close` methods as expected.

It is recommended to make the bean definition method of such beans return the most specific
known implementation, as shown in the following example:

.Define a step-scoped bean with the most specific return type
[source, java]
----
@Bean
@StepScope
public FlatFileItemReader flatFileItemReader(@Value("#{jobParameters['input.file.name']}") String name) {
	return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<Foo>()
			.resource(new FileSystemResource(name))
			// set other properties of the item reader
			.build();
}
