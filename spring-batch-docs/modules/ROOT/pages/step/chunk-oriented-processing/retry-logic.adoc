= Configuring Retry Logic

In most cases, you want an exception to cause either a skip or a `Step` failure. However,
not all exceptions are deterministic. If a `FlatFileParseException` is encountered while
reading, it is always thrown for that record. Resetting the `ItemReader` does not help.
However, for other exceptions (such as a `DeadlockLoserDataAccessException`, which
indicates that the current process has attempted to update a record that another process
holds a lock on), waiting and trying again might result in success.

Java::

In Java, retry should be configured as follows:
+
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Step step1(JobRepository jobRepository, PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager) {
	return new StepBuilder("step1", jobRepository)
				.<String, String>chunk(2, transactionManager)
				.reader(itemReader())
				.writer(itemWriter())
				.faultTolerant()
				.retryLimit(3)
				.retry(DeadlockLoserDataAccessException.class)
				.build();
}

XML::
+
In XML, retry should be configured as follows:
+
[source, xml]
----
<step id="step1">
   <tasklet>
      <chunk reader="itemReader" writer="itemWriter"
             commit-interval="2" retry-limit="3">
         <retryable-exception-classes>
            <include class="org.springframework.dao.DeadlockLoserDataAccessException"/>
         </retryable-exception-classes>
      </chunk>
   </tasklet>
</step>

The `Step` allows a limit for the number of times an individual item can be retried and a
list of exceptions that are "`retryable`". You can find more details on how retry works in
<<retry.adoc#retry, retry>>.
