[[interceptingStepExecution]]
= Intercepting `Step` Execution

Just as with the `Job`, there are many events during the execution of a `Step` where a
user may need to perform some functionality. For example, to write out to a flat
file that requires a footer, the `ItemWriter` needs to be notified when the `Step` has
been completed so that the footer can be written. This can be accomplished with one of many
`Step` scoped listeners.

You can apply any class that implements one of the extensions of `StepListener` (but not that interface
itself, since it is empty) to a step through the `listeners` element.
The `listeners` element is valid inside a step, tasklet, or chunk declaration.  We
recommend that you declare the listeners at the level at which its function applies
or, if it is multi-featured (such as `StepExecutionListener` and `ItemReadListener`),
declare it at the most granular level where it applies.

An `ItemReader`, `ItemWriter`, or `ItemProcessor` that itself implements one of the
`StepListener` interfaces is registered automatically with the `Step` if using the
namespace `<step>` element or one of the `*StepFactoryBean` factories. This only
applies to components directly injected into the `Step`. If the listener is nested inside
another component, you need to explicitly register it (as described previously under
xref:step/chunk-oriented-processing/registering-item-streams.adoc[Registering `ItemStream` with a `Step`]).

In addition to the `StepListener` interfaces, annotations are provided to address the
same concerns. Plain old Java objects can have methods with these annotations that are
then converted into the corresponding `StepListener` type. It is also common to annotate
custom implementations of chunk components, such as `ItemReader` or `ItemWriter` or
`Tasklet`. The annotations are analyzed by the XML parser for the `<listener/>` elements
as well as registered with the `listener` methods in the builders, so all you need to do
is use the XML namespace or builders to register the listeners with a step.

[[stepExecutionListener]]
== `StepExecutionListener`

`StepExecutionListener` represents the most generic listener for `Step` execution. It
allows for notification before a `Step` is started and after it ends, whether it ended
normally or failed, as the following example shows:

[source, java]
----
public interface StepExecutionListener extends StepListener {

    void beforeStep(StepExecution stepExecution);

    ExitStatus afterStep(StepExecution stepExecution);

}
----

`ExitStatus` has a return type of `afterStep`, to give listeners the chance to
modify the exit code that is returned upon completion of a `Step`.

The annotations corresponding to this interface are:

* `@BeforeStep`
* `@AfterStep`

[[chunkListener]]
== `ChunkListener`

A "`chunk`" is defined as the items processed within the scope of a transaction. Committing a
transaction, at each commit interval, commits a chunk. You can use a `ChunkListener` to
perform logic before a chunk begins processing or after a chunk has completed
successfully, as the following interface definition shows:

[source, java]
----
public interface ChunkListener extends StepListener {

    void beforeChunk(ChunkContext context);
    void afterChunk(ChunkContext context);
    void afterChunkError(ChunkContext context);

}
----

The beforeChunk method is called after the transaction is started but before reading begins
on the `ItemReader`. Conversely, `afterChunk` is called after the chunk has been
committed (or not at all if there is a rollback).

The annotations corresponding to this interface are:

* `@BeforeChunk`
* `@AfterChunk`
* `@AfterChunkError`

You can apply a `ChunkListener` when there is no chunk declaration. The `TaskletStep` is
responsible for calling the `ChunkListener`, so it applies to a non-item-oriented tasklet
as well (it is called before and after the tasklet).

A `ChunkListener` is not designed to throw checked exceptions. Errors must be handled in the
implementation or the step will terminate.

[[itemReadListener]]
== `ItemReadListener`

When discussing skip logic previously, it was mentioned that it may be beneficial to log
the skipped records so that they can be dealt with later. In the case of read errors,
this can be done with an `ItemReaderListener`, as the following interface
definition shows:

[source, java]
----
public interface ItemReadListener<T> extends StepListener {

    void beforeRead();
    void afterRead(T item);
    void onReadError(Exception ex);

}
----

The `beforeRead` method is called before each call to read on the `ItemReader`. The
`afterRead` method is called after each successful call to read and is passed the item
that was read. If there was an error while reading, the `onReadError` method is called.
The exception encountered is provided so that it can be logged.

The annotations corresponding to this interface are:

* `@BeforeRead`
* `@AfterRead`
* `@OnReadError`

[[itemProcessListener]]
== `ItemProcessListener`

As with the `ItemReadListener`, the processing of an item can be "`listened`" to, as
the following interface definition shows:

[source, java]
----
public interface ItemProcessListener<T, S> extends StepListener {

    void beforeProcess(T item);
    void afterProcess(T item, S result);
    void onProcessError(T item, Exception e);

}
----

The `beforeProcess` method is called before `process` on the `ItemProcessor` and is
handed the item that is to be processed. The `afterProcess` method is called after the
item has been successfully processed. If there was an error while processing, the
`onProcessError` method is called. The exception encountered and the item that was
attempted to be processed are provided, so that they can be logged.

The annotations corresponding to this interface are:

* `@BeforeProcess`
* `@AfterProcess`
* `@OnProcessError`

[[itemWriteListener]]
== `ItemWriteListener`

You can "`listen`" to the writing of an item with the `ItemWriteListener`, as the
following interface definition shows:

[source, java]
----
public interface ItemWriteListener<S> extends StepListener {

    void beforeWrite(List<? extends S> items);
    void afterWrite(List<? extends S> items);
    void onWriteError(Exception exception, List<? extends S> items);

}
----

The `beforeWrite` method is called before `write` on the `ItemWriter` and is handed the
list of items that is written. The `afterWrite` method is called after the items have been
successfully written, but before committing the transaction associated with the chunk's processing.
If there was an error while writing, the `onWriteError` method is called.
The exception encountered and the item that was attempted to be written are
provided, so that they can be logged.

The annotations corresponding to this interface are:

* `@BeforeWrite`
* `@AfterWrite`
* `@OnWriteError`

[[skipListener]]
== `SkipListener`

`ItemReadListener`, `ItemProcessListener`, and `ItemWriteListener` all provide mechanisms
for being notified of errors, but none informs you that a record has actually been
skipped. `onWriteError`, for example, is called even if an item is retried and
successful. For this reason, there is a separate interface for tracking skipped items, as
the following interface definition shows:

[source, java]
----
public interface SkipListener<T,S> extends StepListener {

    void onSkipInRead(Throwable t);
    void onSkipInProcess(T item, Throwable t);
    void onSkipInWrite(S item, Throwable t);

}
----

`onSkipInRead` is called whenever an item is skipped while reading. It should be noted
that rollbacks may cause the same item to be registered as skipped more than once.
`onSkipInWrite` is called when an item is skipped while writing. Because the item has
been read successfully (and not skipped), it is also provided the item itself as an
argument.

The annotations corresponding to this interface are:

* `@OnSkipInRead`
* `@OnSkipInWrite`
* `@OnSkipInProcess`

[[skipListenersAndTransactions]]
=== SkipListeners and Transactions

One of the most common use cases for a `SkipListener` is to log out a skipped item, so
that another batch process or even human process can be used to evaluate and fix the
issue that leads to the skip. Because there are many cases in which the original transaction
may be rolled back, Spring Batch makes two guarantees:

* The appropriate skip method (depending on when the error happened) is called only once
per item.
* The `SkipListener` is always called just before the transaction is committed. This is
to ensure that any transactional resources call by the listener are not rolled back by a
failure within the `ItemWriter`.
