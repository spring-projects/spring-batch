= Registering `ItemStream` with a `Step`

The step has to take care of `ItemStream` callbacks at the necessary points in its
lifecycle. (For more information on the `ItemStream` interface, see
xref:readers-and-writers/item-stream.adoc[ItemStream]). This is vital if a step fails and might
need to be restarted, because the `ItemStream` interface is where the step gets the
information it needs about persistent state between executions.

If the `ItemReader`, `ItemProcessor`, or `ItemWriter` itself implements the `ItemStream`
interface, these are registered automatically. Any other streams need to be
registered separately. This is often the case where indirect dependencies, such as
delegates, are injected into the reader and writer. You can register a stream on the
`step` through the `stream` element.

	writers.add(fileItemWriter1());
	writers.add(fileItemWriter2());

	CompositeItemWriter itemWriter = new CompositeItemWriter();

	itemWriter.setDelegates(writers);

In the preceding example, the `CompositeItemWriter` is not an `ItemStream`, but both of its
delegates are. Therefore, both delegate writers must be explicitly registered as streams
for the framework to handle them correctly. The `ItemReader` does not need to be
explicitly registered as a stream because it is a direct property of the `Step`. The step
is now restartable, and the state of the reader and writer is correctly persisted in the
event of a failure.
