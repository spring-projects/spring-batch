= Configuring Skip Logic

There are many scenarios where errors encountered while processing should not result in
`Step` failure but should be skipped instead. This is usually a decision that must be
made by someone who understands the data itself and what meaning it has. Financial data,
for example, may not be skippable because it results in money being transferred, which
needs to be completely accurate. Loading a list of vendors, on the other hand, might
allow for skips. If a vendor is not loaded because it was formatted incorrectly or was
missing necessary information, there probably are not issues. Usually, these bad
records are logged as well, which is covered later when discussing listeners.

         </skippable-exception-classes>
      </chunk>
   </tasklet>

In the preceding example, a `FlatFileItemReader` is used. If, at any point, a
`FlatFileParseException` is thrown, the item is skipped and counted against the total
skip limit of 10. Exceptions (and their subclasses) that are declared might be thrown
during any phase of the chunk processing (read, process, or write). Separate counts
are made of skips on read, process, and write inside
the step execution, but the limit applies across all skips. Once the skip limit is
reached, the next exception found causes the step to fail. In other words, the eleventh
skip triggers the exception, not the tenth.

One problem with the preceding example is that any other exception besides a
`FlatFileParseException` causes the `Job` to fail. In certain scenarios, this may be the
correct behavior. However, in other scenarios, it may be easier to identify which
exceptions should cause failure and skip everything else.

By identifying `java.lang.Exception` as a skippable exception class, the configuration
indicates that all `Exceptions` are skippable. However, by "`excluding`"
`java.io.FileNotFoundException`, the configuration refines the list of skippable
exception classes to be all `Exceptions` __except__ `FileNotFoundException`. Any excluded
exception class is fatal if encountered (that is, they are not skipped).

For any exception encountered, the skippability is determined by the nearest superclass
in the class hierarchy. Any unclassified exception is treated as 'fatal'.
