[[configuringAJob]]
= Configuring a Job

There are multiple implementations of the xref:job.adoc[`Job`] interface. However,
these implementations are abstracted behind either the provided builders (for Java configuration) or the XML
namespace (for XML-based configuration). The following example shows both Java and XML configuration:

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Job footballJob(JobRepository jobRepository) {
    return new JobBuilder("footballJob", jobRepository)
                     .start(playerLoad())
                     .next(gameLoad())
                     .next(playerSummarization())
                     .build();
}
----
+
A `Job` (and, typically, any `Step` within it) requires a `JobRepository`.  The
configuration of the `JobRepository` is handled through the xref:job/java-config.adoc[`Java Configuration`].
+
The preceding example illustrates a `Job` that consists of three `Step` instances.  The job related
builders can also contain other elements that help with parallelization (`Split`),
declarative flow control (`Decision`), and externalization of flow definitions (`Flow`).

XML::
+
There are multiple implementations of the xref:job.adoc[`Job`]
interface. However, the namespace abstracts away the differences in configuration. It has
only three required dependencies: a name, `JobRepository` , and a list of `Step` instances.
The following example creates a `footballJob`:
+
[source, xml]
----
<job id="footballJob">
    <step id="playerload"          parent="s1" next="gameLoad"/>
    <step id="gameLoad"            parent="s2" next="playerSummarization"/>
    <step id="playerSummarization" parent="s3"/>
</job>
----
+
The preceding examples uses a parent bean definition to create the steps.
See the section on xref:step.adoc[step configuration]
for more options when declaring specific step details inline. The XML namespace
defaults to referencing a repository with an `id` of `jobRepository`, which
is a sensible default. However, you can explicitly override this default:
+
[source, xml]
----
<job id="footballJob" job-repository="specialRepository">
    <step id="playerload"          parent="s1" next="gameLoad"/>
    <step id="gameLoad"            parent="s3" next="playerSummarization"/>
    <step id="playerSummarization" parent="s3"/>
</job>
----
+
In addition to steps, a job configuration can contain other elements
that help with parallelization (`<split>`),
declarative flow control (`<decision>`), and
externalization of flow definitions
(`<flow/>`).

[[restartability]]
== Restartability

One key issue when executing a batch job concerns the behavior of a `Job` when it is
restarted. The launching of a `Job` is considered to be a "`restart`" if a `JobExecution`
already exists for the particular `JobInstance`. Ideally, all jobs should be able to start
up where they left off, but there are scenarios where this is not possible.
_In this scenario, it is entirely up to the developer to ensure that a new `JobInstance` is created._
However, Spring Batch does provide some help. If a `Job` should never be
restarted but should always be run as part of a new `JobInstance`, you can set the
restartable property to `false`.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
The following example shows how to set the `restartable` field to `false` in Java:
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Job footballJob(JobRepository jobRepository) {
    return new JobBuilder("footballJob", jobRepository)
                     .preventRestart()
                     ...
                     .build();
}
----

XML::
+
The following example shows how to set the `restartable` field to `false` in XML:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<job id="footballJob" restartable="false">
    ...
</job>
----
====

To phrase it another way, setting `restartable` to `false` means "`this
`Job` does not support being started again`". Restarting a `Job` that is not
restartable causes a `JobRestartException` to
be thrown.
The following Junit code causes the exception to be thrown:

[source, java]
----
Job job = new SimpleJob();
job.setRestartable(false);

JobParameters jobParameters = new JobParameters();

JobExecution firstExecution = jobRepository.createJobExecution(job, jobParameters);
jobRepository.saveOrUpdate(firstExecution);

try {
    jobRepository.createJobExecution(job, jobParameters);
    fail();
}
catch (JobRestartException e) {
    // expected
}
----

The first attempt to create a
`JobExecution` for a non-restartable
job causes no issues. However, the second
attempt throws a `JobRestartException`.

[[interceptingJobExecution]]
== Intercepting Job Execution

During the course of the execution of a
`Job`, it may be useful to be notified of various
events in its lifecycle so that custom code can be run.
`SimpleJob` allows for this by calling a
`JobListener` at the appropriate time:

[source, java]
----
public interface JobExecutionListener {

    void beforeJob(JobExecution jobExecution);

    void afterJob(JobExecution jobExecution);
}
----

You can add `JobListeners` to a `SimpleJob` by setting listeners on the job.


[tabs]
====
Java::
+
The following example shows how to add a listener method to a Java job definition:
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Job footballJob(JobRepository jobRepository) {
    return new JobBuilder("footballJob", jobRepository)
                     .listener(sampleListener())
                     ...
                     .build();
}
----

XML::
+
The following example shows how to add a listener element to an XML job definition:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<job id="footballJob">
    <step id="playerload"          parent="s1" next="gameLoad"/>
    <step id="gameLoad"            parent="s2" next="playerSummarization"/>
    <step id="playerSummarization" parent="s3"/>
    <listeners>
        <listener ref="sampleListener"/>
    </listeners>
</job>
----
====

Note that the `afterJob` method is called regardless of the success or
failure of the `Job`. If you need to determine success or failure, you can get that information
from the `JobExecution`:

[source, java]
----
public void afterJob(JobExecution jobExecution){
    if (jobExecution.getStatus() == BatchStatus.COMPLETED ) {
        //job success
    }
    else if (jobExecution.getStatus() == BatchStatus.FAILED) {
        //job failure
    }
}
----

The annotations corresponding to this interface are:

* `@BeforeJob`
* `@AfterJob`

[[inheriting-from-a-parent-job]]
== Inheriting from a Parent Job

ifdef::backend-pdf[]
This section applies only to XML based configuration, as Java configuration provides better
reuse capabilities.
endif::backend-pdf[]

[role="xmlContent"]
If a group of Jobs share similar but not
identical configurations, it may help to define a "`parent`"
`Job` from which the concrete
`Job` instances can inherit properties. Similar to class
inheritance in Java, a "`child`" `Job` combines
its elements and attributes with the parent's.

[role="xmlContent"]
In the following example, `baseJob` is an abstract
`Job` definition that defines only a list of
listeners. The `Job` (`job1`) is a concrete
definition that inherits the list of listeners from `baseJob` and merges
it with its own list of listeners to produce a
`Job` with two listeners and one
`Step` (`step1`).

[source, xml]
----
<job id="baseJob" abstract="true">
    <listeners>
        <listener ref="listenerOne"/>
    <listeners>
</job>

<job id="job1" parent="baseJob">
    <step id="step1" parent="standaloneStep"/>

    <listeners merge="true">
        <listener ref="listenerTwo"/>
    <listeners>
</job>
----

[role="xmlContent"]

for more detailed information.

[[jobparametersvalidator]]
== JobParametersValidator

A job declared in the XML namespace or using any subclass of
`AbstractJob` can optionally declare a validator for the job parameters at
runtime. This is useful when, for instance, you need to assert that a job
is started with all its mandatory parameters. There is a
`DefaultJobParametersValidator` that you can use to constrain combinations
of simple mandatory and optional parameters. For more complex
constraints, you can implement the interface yourself.


[tabs]
====
Java::
+
The configuration of a validator is supported through the Java builders:
+
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Job job1(JobRepository jobRepository) {
    return new JobBuilder("job1", jobRepository)
                     .validator(parametersValidator())
                     ...
                     .build();
}
----

XML::
+
The configuration of a validator is supported through the XML namespace through a child
element of the job, as the following example shows:
+
[source, xml]
----
<job id="job1" parent="baseJob3">
    <step id="step1" parent="standaloneStep"/>
    <validator ref="parametersValidator"/>
</job>
----
+
You can specify the validator as a reference (as shown earlier) or as a nested bean
definition in  the `beans` namespace.
