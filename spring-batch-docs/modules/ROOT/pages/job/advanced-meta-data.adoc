[[advancedMetaData]]
= Advanced Metadata Usage

So far, both the `JobLauncher` and `JobRepository` interfaces have been
discussed. Together, they represent the simple launching of a job and basic
CRUD operations of batch domain objects:

.Job Repository
image::job-repository.png[Job Repository, scaledwidth="60%"]

A `JobLauncher` uses the
`JobRepository` to create new
`JobExecution` objects and run them.
`Job` and `Step` implementations
later use the same `JobRepository` for basic updates
of the same executions during the running of a `Job`.
The basic operations suffice for simple scenarios. However, in a large batch
environment with hundreds of batch jobs and complex scheduling
requirements, more advanced access to the metadata is required:

.Advanced Job Repository Access
image::job-repository-advanced.png[Job Repository Advanced, scaledwidth="80%"]

The `JobExplorer` and
`JobOperator` interfaces, which are discussed
in the coming sections, add additional functionality for querying and controlling the metadata.

[[queryingRepository]]
== Querying the Repository

The most basic need before any advanced features is the ability to
query the repository for existing executions. This functionality is
provided by the `JobExplorer` interface:

[source, java]
----
public interface JobExplorer {

    List<JobInstance> getJobInstances(String jobName, int start, int count);

    JobExecution getJobExecution(Long executionId);

    StepExecution getStepExecution(Long jobExecutionId, Long stepExecutionId);

    JobInstance getJobInstance(Long instanceId);

    List<JobExecution> getJobExecutions(JobInstance jobInstance);

    Set<JobExecution> findRunningJobExecutions(String jobName);
}
----

As is evident from its method signatures, `JobExplorer` is a read-only version of
the `JobRepository`, and, like the `JobRepository`, it can be easily configured by using a
factory bean.

xref:job/configuring-repository.adoc#repositoryTablePrefix[Earlier in this chapter], we noted that you can modify the table prefix
of the `JobRepository` to allow for different versions or schemas. Because
the `JobExplorer` works with the same tables, it also needs the ability to set a prefix.

[[jobregistry]]
== JobRegistry

A `JobRegistry` (and its parent interface, `JobLocator`) is not mandatory, but it can be
useful if you want to keep track of which jobs are available in the context. It is also
useful for collecting jobs centrally in an application context when they have been created
elsewhere (for example, in child contexts). You can also use custom `JobRegistry` implementations
to manipulate the names and other properties of the jobs that are registered.
There is only one implementation provided by the framework and this is based on a simple
map from job name to job instance.

When using `@EnableBatchProcessing`, a `JobRegistry` is provided for you.
The following example shows how to configure your own `JobRegistry`:

====

You can populate a `JobRegistry` in one of the following ways: by using
a bean post processor, or by using a smart initializing singleton or by using
a registrar lifecycle component. The coming sections describe these mechanisms.

[[jobregistrysmartinitializingsingleton]]

This is a `SmartInitializingSingleton` that registers all singleton jobs within the job registry.

[[automaticjobregistrar]]
=== AutomaticJobRegistrar

This is a lifecycle component that creates child contexts and registers jobs from those
contexts as they are created. One advantage of doing this is that, while the job names in
the child contexts still have to be globally unique in the registry, their dependencies
can have "`natural`" names. So, for example, you can create a set of XML configuration files
that each have only one Job but that all have different definitions of an `ItemReader` with the
same bean name, such as `reader`. If all those files were imported into the same context,
the reader definitions would clash and override one another, but, with the automatic
registrar, this is avoided. This makes it easier to integrate jobs that have been contributed from
separate modules of an application.

    registrar.setJobLoader(jobLoader());

    return registrar;

}

         <property name="jobRegistry" ref="jobRegistry" />
      </bean>
   </property>
</bean>
----

====



The registrar has two mandatory properties: an array of
`ApplicationContextFactory` (created from a
convenient factory bean in the preceding example) and a
`JobLoader`. The `JobLoader`
is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the child contexts and
registering jobs in the `JobRegistry`.

The `ApplicationContextFactory` is
responsible for creating the child context. The most common usage
is (as in the preceding example) to use a
`ClassPathXmlApplicationContextFactory`. One of
the features of this factory is that, by default, it copies some of the
configuration down from the parent context to the child. So, for
instance, you need not redefine the
`PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer` or AOP
configuration in the child, provided it should be the same as the
parent.

You can use `AutomaticJobRegistrar` in
conjunction with a `JobRegistrySmartInitializingSingleton`
(as long as you also use `DefaultJobLoader`).
For instance, this might be desirable if there are jobs
defined in the main parent context as well as in the child
locations.

[[JobOperator]]
== JobOperator

As previously discussed, the `JobRepository`
provides CRUD operations on the meta-data, and the
`JobExplorer` provides read-only operations on the
metadata. However, those operations are most useful when used together
to perform common monitoring tasks such as stopping, restarting, or
summarizing a Job, as is commonly done by batch operators. Spring Batch
provides these types of operations in the
`JobOperator` interface:

[source, java]
----
public interface JobOperator {

    List<Long> getExecutions(long instanceId) throws NoSuchJobInstanceException;

    List<Long> getJobInstances(String jobName, int start, int count)
          throws NoSuchJobException;

    Set<Long> getRunningExecutions(String jobName) throws NoSuchJobException;

    String getParameters(long executionId) throws NoSuchJobExecutionException;

    Long start(String jobName, String parameters)
          throws NoSuchJobException, JobInstanceAlreadyExistsException;

    Long restart(long executionId)
          throws JobInstanceAlreadyCompleteException, NoSuchJobExecutionException,
                  NoSuchJobException, JobRestartException;

    Long startNextInstance(String jobName)
          throws NoSuchJobException, JobParametersNotFoundException, JobRestartException,
                 JobExecutionAlreadyRunningException, JobInstanceAlreadyCompleteException;

    boolean stop(long executionId)
          throws NoSuchJobExecutionException, JobExecutionNotRunningException;

    String getSummary(long executionId) throws NoSuchJobExecutionException;

    Map<Long, String> getStepExecutionSummaries(long executionId)
          throws NoSuchJobExecutionException;

    Set<String> getJobNames();

}
----

The preceding operations represent methods from many different interfaces, such as
`JobLauncher`, `JobRepository`, `JobExplorer`, and `JobRegistry`. For this reason, the
provided implementation of `JobOperator` (`SimpleJobOperator`) has many dependencies.

As of version 5.0, the `@EnableBatchProcessing` annotation automatically registers a job operator bean
in the application context.

NOTE: If you set the table prefix on the job repository, do not forget to set it on the job explorer as well.

[[JobParametersIncrementer]]
== JobParametersIncrementer

Most of the methods on `JobOperator` are
self-explanatory, and you can find more detailed explanations in the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/current/api/org/springframework/batch/core/launch/JobOperator.html[Javadoc of the interface]. However, the
`startNextInstance` method is worth noting. This
method always starts a new instance of a `Job`.
This can be extremely useful if there are serious issues in a
`JobExecution` and the `Job`
needs to be started over again from the beginning. Unlike
`JobLauncher` (which requires a new
`JobParameters` object that triggers a new
`JobInstance`), if the parameters are different from
any previous set of parameters, the
`startNextInstance` method uses the
`JobParametersIncrementer` tied to the
`Job` to force the `Job` to a
new instance:

[source, java]
----
public interface JobParametersIncrementer {

    JobParameters getNext(JobParameters parameters);

}
----

The contract of `JobParametersIncrementer` is
that, given a xref:domain.adoc#jobParameters[JobParameters]
object, it returns the "`next`" `JobParameters`
object by incrementing any necessary values it may contain. This
strategy is useful because the framework has no way of knowing what
changes to the `JobParameters` make it the "`next`"
instance. For example, if the only value in
`JobParameters` is a date and the next instance
should be created, should that value be incremented by one day or one
week (if the job is weekly, for instance)? The same can be said for any
numerical values that help to identify the `Job`,
as the following example shows:

[source, java]
----
public class SampleIncrementer implements JobParametersIncrementer {

    public JobParameters getNext(JobParameters parameters) {
        if (parameters==null || parameters.isEmpty()) {
            return new JobParametersBuilder().addLong("run.id", 1L).toJobParameters();
        }
        long id = parameters.getLong("run.id",1L) + 1;
        return new JobParametersBuilder().addLong("run.id", id).toJobParameters();
    }
}
----

In this example, the value with a key of `run.id` is used to
discriminate between `JobInstances`. If the
`JobParameters` passed in is null, it can be
assumed that the `Job` has never been run before
and, thus, its initial state can be returned. However, if not, the old
value is obtained, incremented by one, and returned.

For jobs defined in Java, you can associate an incrementer with a `Job` through the
`incrementer` method provided in the builders, as follows:

public Job footballJob(JobRepository jobRepository) {
    return new JobBuilder("footballJob", jobRepository)
    				 .incrementer(sampleIncrementer())
    				 ...
                     .build();
}
----

+
For jobs defined in XML, you can associate an incrementer with a `Job` through the
`incrementer` attribute in the namespace, as follows:

    ...
</job>
----

[[stoppingAJob]]
== Stopping a Job

One of the most common use cases of
`JobOperator` is gracefully stopping a
Job:

[source, java]
----
Set<Long> executions = jobOperator.getRunningExecutions("sampleJob");
jobOperator.stop(executions.iterator().next());
----

The shutdown is not immediate, since there is no way to force
immediate shutdown, especially if the execution is currently in
developer code that the framework has no control over, such as a
business service. However, as soon as control is returned back to the
framework, it sets the status of the current
`StepExecution` to
`BatchStatus.STOPPED`, saves it, and does the same
for the `JobExecution` before finishing.

[[aborting-a-job]]
== Aborting a Job

A job execution that is `FAILED` can be
restarted (if the `Job` is restartable). A job execution whose status is
`ABANDONED` cannot be restarted by the framework.
The `ABANDONED` status is also used in step
executions to mark them as skippable in a restarted job execution. If a
job is running and encounters a step that has been marked
`ABANDONED` in the previous failed job execution, it
moves on to the next step (as determined by the job flow definition
and the step execution exit status).

If the process died (`kill -9` or server
failure), the job is, of course, not running, but the `JobRepository` has
no way of knowing because no one told it before the process died. You
have to tell it manually that you know that the execution either failed
or should be considered aborted (change its status to
`FAILED` or `ABANDONED`). This is
a business decision, and there is no way to automate it. Change the
status to `FAILED` only if it is restartable and you know that the restart data is valid.
