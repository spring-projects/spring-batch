[[configuringJobRepository]]
= Configuring a JobRepository

As described earlier, the xref:job.adoc[`JobRepository`] is used for basic CRUD operations of the various persisted
domain objects within Spring Batch, such as `JobExecution` and `StepExecution`.
It is required by many of the major framework features, such as the `JobLauncher`,
`Job`, and `Step`.


// FIXME: This did not quite convert properly

====
Java::
+
When using `@EnableBatchProcessing`, a `JobRepository` is provided for you.
This section describes how to configure your own.
+
Other than the `dataSource` and  the `transactionManager`, none of the configuration options listed earlier are required.
If they are not set, the defaults shown earlier
are used. The
max `varchar` length defaults to `2500`, which is the
length of the long `VARCHAR` columns in the
xref:schema-appendix.adoc#metaDataSchemaOverview[sample schema scripts]


XML::
+
The batch namespace abstracts away many of the implementation details of the
`JobRepository` implementations and their collaborators. However, there are still a few
configuration options available, as the following example shows:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<job-repository id="jobRepository"
    data-source="dataSource"
    transaction-manager="transactionManager"
    isolation-level-for-create="SERIALIZABLE"
    table-prefix="BATCH_"
	max-varchar-length="1000"/>

.

[[txConfigForJobRepository]]
== Transaction Configuration for the JobRepository

If the namespace or the provided `FactoryBean` is used, transactional advice is
automatically created around the repository. This is to ensure that the batch metadata,
including state that is necessary for restarts after a failure, is persisted correctly.
The behavior of the framework is not well defined if the repository methods are not
transactional. The isolation level in the `create*` method attributes is specified
separately to ensure that, when jobs are launched, if two processes try to launch
the same job at the same time, only one succeeds. The default isolation level for that
method is `SERIALIZABLE`, which is quite aggressive. `READ_COMMITTED` usually works equally
well. `READ_UNCOMMITTED` is fine if two processes are not likely to collide in this
way. However, since a call to the `create*` method is quite short, it is unlikely that
`SERIALIZED` causes problems, as long as the database platform supports it. However, you
can override this setting.


[tabs]
====
Java::
+
The following example shows how to override the isolation level in Java:
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing(isolationLevelForCreate = "ISOLATION_REPEATABLE_READ")
public class MyJobConfiguration {

   // job definition

}
----

XML::
+
The following example shows how to override the isolation level in XML:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<job-repository id="jobRepository"
                isolation-level-for-create="REPEATABLE_READ" />
----
====


If the namespace is not used, you must also configure the
transactional behavior of the repository by using AOP.

The following example shows how to configure the transactional behavior of the repository
in Java:

.Java Configuration
[source, java]

@Bean
public TransactionProxyFactoryBean baseProxy() {
	TransactionProxyFactoryBean transactionProxyFactoryBean = new TransactionProxyFactoryBean();
	Properties transactionAttributes = new Properties();
	transactionAttributes.setProperty("*", "PROPAGATION_REQUIRED");
	transactionProxyFactoryBean.setTransactionAttributes(transactionAttributes);
	transactionProxyFactoryBean.setTarget(jobRepository());
	transactionProxyFactoryBean.setTransactionManager(transactionManager());
	return transactionProxyFactoryBean;
}
----

XML::
+
The following example shows how to configure the transactional behavior of the repository
in XML:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<aop:config>
    <aop:advisor
           pointcut="execution(* org.springframework.batch.core..*Repository+.*(..))"/>
    <advice-ref="txAdvice" />
</aop:config>

<tx:advice id="txAdvice" transaction-manager="transactionManager">
    <tx:attributes>
        <tx:method name="*" />
    </tx:attributes>
</tx:advice>
----
+
You can use the preceding fragment nearly as is, with almost no changes. Remember also to
include the  appropriate namespace declarations and to make sure `spring-tx` and `spring-aop`
(or the whole of Spring) are on the classpath.

[[repositoryTablePrefix]]
== Changing the Table Prefix

Another modifiable property of the `JobRepository` is the table prefix of the meta-data
tables. By default, they are all prefaced with `BATCH_`. `BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION` and
`BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION` are two examples. However, there are potential reasons to modify this
prefix. If the schema names need to be prepended to the table names or if more than one
set of metadata tables is needed within the same schema, the table prefix needs to
be changed.


[tabs]
====
Java::
+
The following example shows how to change the table prefix in Java:
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableBatchProcessing(tablePrefix = "SYSTEM.TEST_")
public class MyJobConfiguration {

   // job definition

}
----

XML::
+
The following example shows how to change the table prefix in XML:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<job-repository id="jobRepository"
                table-prefix="SYSTEM.TEST_" />
----

====





Given the preceding changes, every query to the metadata tables is prefixed with
`SYSTEM.TEST_`. `BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION` is referred to as `SYSTEM.TEST_JOB_EXECUTION`.

NOTE: Only the table prefix is configurable. The table and column names are not.

[[nonStandardDatabaseTypesInRepository]]
== Non-standard Database Types in a Repository

If you use a database platform that is not in the list of supported platforms, you
may be able to use one of the supported types, if the SQL variant is close enough. To do
this, you can use the raw `JobRepositoryFactoryBean` instead of the namespace shortcut and
use it to set the database type to the closest match.

[tabs]
====
Java::
+
The following example shows how to use `JobRepositoryFactoryBean` to set the database type
to the closest match in Java:
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public JobRepository jobRepository() throws Exception {
    JobRepositoryFactoryBean factory = new JobRepositoryFactoryBean();
    factory.setDataSource(dataSource);
    factory.setDatabaseType("db2");
    factory.setTransactionManager(transactionManager);
    return factory.getObject();
}
----

XML::
+
The following example shows how to use `JobRepositoryFactoryBean` to set the database type
to the closest match in XML:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="jobRepository" class="org...JobRepositoryFactoryBean">
    <property name="databaseType" value="db2"/>
    <property name="dataSource" ref="dataSource"/>
</bean>
----

====


If the database type is not specified, the `JobRepositoryFactoryBean` tries to
auto-detect the database type from the `DataSource`.
The major differences between platforms are
mainly accounted for by the strategy for incrementing primary keys, so
it is often necessary to override the
`incrementerFactory` as well (by using one of the standard
implementations from the Spring Framework).

If even that does not work or if you are not using an RDBMS, the
only option may be to implement the various `Dao`
interfaces that the `SimpleJobRepository` depends
on and wire one up manually in the normal Spring way.
