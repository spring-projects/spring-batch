= Configuring a JobLauncher


[tabs]

Java::

When you use `@EnableBatchProcessing`, a `JobRegistry` is provided for you.
This section describes how to configure your own.

XML::

// FIXME what is the XML equivalent?
====


The most basic implementation of the `JobLauncher` interface is the `TaskExecutorJobLauncher`.
Its only required dependency is a `JobRepository` (needed to obtain an execution).

@Bean
public JobLauncher jobLauncher() throws Exception {
	TaskExecutorJobLauncher jobLauncher = new TaskExecutorJobLauncher();
	jobLauncher.setJobRepository(jobRepository);
	jobLauncher.afterPropertiesSet();
	return jobLauncher;
}

Once a xref:domain.adoc[JobExecution] is obtained, it is passed to the
execute method of `Job`, ultimately returning the `JobExecution` to the caller, as
the following image shows:

.Job Launcher Sequence

The sequence is straightforward and works well when launched from a scheduler. However,
issues arise when trying to launch from an HTTP request. In this scenario, the launching
needs to be done asynchronously so that the `TaskExecutorJobLauncher` returns immediately to its
caller. This is because it is not good practice to keep an HTTP request open for the
amount of time needed by long running processes (such as batch jobs). The following image shows
an example sequence:

.Asynchronous Job Launcher Sequence
image::job-launcher-sequence-async.png[Async Job Launcher Sequence, scaledwidth="60%"]

You can configure the `TaskExecutorJobLauncher` to allow for this scenario by configuring a
`TaskExecutor`.

You can use any implementation of the spring `TaskExecutor`
interface to control how jobs are asynchronously
executed.
