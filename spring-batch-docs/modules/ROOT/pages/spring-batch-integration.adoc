Many users of Spring Batch may encounter requirements that are
outside the scope of Spring Batch but that may be efficiently and
concisely implemented by using Spring Integration. Conversely, Spring
Integration users may encounter Spring Batch requirements and need a way
to efficiently integrate both frameworks. In this context, several
patterns and use-cases emerge, and Spring Batch Integration
addresses those requirements.

The line between Spring Batch and Spring Integration is not always
clear, but two pieces of advice can
help: Thinking about granularity and applying common patterns. Some
of those common patterns are described in this section.

Adding messaging to a batch process enables automation of
operations and also separation and strategizing of key concerns.
For example, a message might trigger a job to execute, and then
sending the message can be exposed in a variety of ways. Alternatively, when
a job completes or fails, that event might trigger a message to be sent,
and the consumers of those messages might have operational concerns
that have nothing to do with the application itself. Messaging can
also be embedded in a job (for example, reading or writing items for
processing through channels). Remote partitioning and remote chunking
provide methods to distribute workloads over a number of workers.
