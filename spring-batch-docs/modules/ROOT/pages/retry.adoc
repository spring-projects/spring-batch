To make processing more robust and less prone to failure, it sometimes helps to
automatically retry a failed operation in case it might succeed on a subsequent attempt.
Errors that are susceptible to intermittent failure are often transient in nature.
Examples include remote calls to a web service that fails because of a network glitch or a
`DeadlockLoserDataAccessException` in a database update.

[NOTE]
====
As of v6.0, Spring Batch does *not* use https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry] to automate retry operations within the framework,
and is now based on the https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/7.0/core/resilience.html[core retry feature] provided by Spring Framework 7.0.
