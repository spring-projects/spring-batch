= Reusing Existing Services

Batch systems are often used in conjunction with other application styles. The most
common is an online system, but it may also support integration or even a thick client
application by moving necessary bulk data that each application style uses. For this
reason, it is common that many users want to reuse existing DAOs or other services within
their batch jobs. The Spring container itself makes this fairly easy by allowing any
necessary class to be injected. However, there may be cases where the existing service
needs to act as an `ItemReader` or `ItemWriter`, either to satisfy the dependency of
another Spring Batch class or because it truly is the main `ItemReader` for a step. It is
fairly trivial to write an adapter class for each service that needs wrapping, but
because it is such a common concern, Spring Batch provides implementations:
`ItemReaderAdapter` and `ItemWriterAdapter`. Both classes implement the standard Spring
method by invoking the delegate pattern and are fairly simple to set up.

Java::

The following Java example uses the `ItemReaderAdapter`:
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public ItemReaderAdapter itemReader() {
	ItemReaderAdapter reader = new ItemReaderAdapter();

	reader.setTargetObject(fooService());
	reader.setTargetMethod("generateFoo");

	return reader;
}

@Bean
public FooService fooService() {
	return new FooService();
}

XML::
+
The following XML example uses the `ItemReaderAdapter`:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="itemReader" class="org.springframework.batch.item.adapter.ItemReaderAdapter">
    <property name="targetObject" ref="fooService" />
    <property name="targetMethod" value="generateFoo" />
</bean>

<bean id="fooService" class="org.springframework.batch.item.sample.FooService" />
----

One important point to note is that the contract of the `targetMethod` must be the same
as the contract for `read`: When exhausted, it returns `null`. Otherwise, it returns an
`Object`. Anything else prevents the framework from knowing when processing should end,
either causing an infinite loop or incorrect failure, depending upon the implementation
of the `ItemWriter`.
