[[flatFileItemReader]]
= `FlatFileItemReader`

A flat file is any type of file that contains at most two-dimensional (tabular) data.
Reading flat files in the Spring Batch framework is facilitated by the class called
`FlatFileItemReader`, which provides basic functionality for reading and parsing flat
files. The two most important required dependencies of `FlatFileItemReader` are
`Resource` and `LineMapper`. The `LineMapper` interface is explored more in the next
sections. The resource property represents a Spring Core `Resource`. Documentation
explaining how to create beans of this type can be found in
link:$$https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#resources$$[Spring
Framework, Chapter 5. Resources]. Therefore, this guide does not go into the details of
creating `Resource` objects beyond showing the following simple example:

[source, java]
----
Resource resource = new FileSystemResource("resources/trades.csv");
----

In complex batch environments, the directory structures are often managed by the Enterprise Application Integration (EAI)
infrastructure, where drop zones for external interfaces are established for moving files
from FTP locations to batch processing locations and vice versa. File moving utilities
are beyond the scope of the Spring Batch architecture, but it is not unusual for batch
job streams to include file moving utilities as steps in the job stream. The batch
architecture only needs to know how to locate the files to be processed. Spring Batch
begins the process of feeding the data into the pipe from this starting point. However,
link:$$https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/$$[Spring Integration] provides many
of these types of services.

The other properties in `FlatFileItemReader` let you further specify how your data is
interpreted, as described in the following table:

.`FlatFileItemReader` Properties
[options="header"]
|===============
|Property|Type|Description
|comments|String[]|Specifies line prefixes that indicate comment rows.
|encoding|String|Specifies what text encoding to use. The default value is `UTF-8`.
|lineMapper|`LineMapper`|Converts a `String` to an `Object` representing the item.
|linesToSkip|int|Number of lines to ignore at the top of the file.
|recordSeparatorPolicy|RecordSeparatorPolicy|Used to determine where the line endings are
and do things like continue over a line ending if inside a quoted string.
|resource|`Resource`|The resource from which to read.
|skippedLinesCallback|LineCallbackHandler|Interface that passes the raw line content of
the lines in the file to be skipped. If `linesToSkip` is set to 2, then this interface is
called twice.
|strict|boolean|In strict mode, the reader throws an exception on `ExecutionContext` if
the input resource does not exist. Otherwise, it logs the problem and continues.
|===============

[[lineMapper]]
== `LineMapper`

As with `RowMapper`, which takes a low-level construct such as `ResultSet` and returns
an `Object`, flat file processing requires the same construct to convert a `String` line
into an `Object`, as shown in the following interface definition:

[source, java]
----
public interface LineMapper<T> {

    T mapLine(String line, int lineNumber) throws Exception;

}
----

The basic contract is that, given the current line and the line number with which it is
associated, the mapper should return a resulting domain object. This is similar to
`RowMapper`, in that each line is associated with its line number, just as each row in a
`ResultSet` is tied to its row number. This allows the line number to be tied to the
resulting domain object for identity comparison or for more informative logging. However,
unlike `RowMapper`, the `LineMapper` is given a raw line which, as discussed above, only
gets you halfway there. The line must be tokenized into a `FieldSet`, which can then be
mapped to an object, as described later in this document.

[[lineTokenizer]]
== `LineTokenizer`

An abstraction for turning a line of input into a `FieldSet` is necessary because there
can be many formats of flat file data that need to be converted to a `FieldSet`. In
Spring Batch, this interface is the `LineTokenizer`:

[source, java]
----
public interface LineTokenizer {

    FieldSet tokenize(String line);

}
----

The contract of a `LineTokenizer` is such that, given a line of input (in theory the
`String` could encompass more than one line), a `FieldSet` representing the line is
returned. This `FieldSet` can then be passed to a `FieldSetMapper`. Spring Batch contains
the following `LineTokenizer` implementations:

* `DelimitedLineTokenizer`: Used for files where fields in a record are separated by a
delimiter. The most common delimiter is a comma, but pipes or semicolons are often used
as well.
* `FixedLengthTokenizer`: Used for files where fields in a record are each a "fixed
width". The width of each field must be defined for each record type.
* `PatternMatchingCompositeLineTokenizer`: Determines which `LineTokenizer` among a list of
tokenizers should be used on a particular line by checking against a pattern.

[[fieldSetMapper]]
== `FieldSetMapper`

The `FieldSetMapper` interface defines a single method, `mapFieldSet`, which takes a
`FieldSet` object and maps its contents to an object. This object may be a custom DTO, a
domain object, or an array, depending on the needs of the job. The `FieldSetMapper` is
used in conjunction with the `LineTokenizer` to translate a line of data from a resource
into an object of the desired type, as shown in the following interface definition:

[source, java]
----
public interface FieldSetMapper<T> {

    T mapFieldSet(FieldSet fieldSet) throws BindException;

}
----

The pattern used is the same as the `RowMapper` used by `JdbcTemplate`.

[[defaultLineMapper]]
== `DefaultLineMapper`

Now that the basic interfaces for reading in flat files have been defined, it becomes
clear that three basic steps are required:

. Read one line from the file.
. Pass the `String` line into the `LineTokenizer#tokenize()` method to retrieve a
`FieldSet`.
. Pass the `FieldSet` returned from tokenizing to a `FieldSetMapper`, returning the
result from the `ItemReader#read()` method.

The two interfaces described above represent two separate tasks: converting a line into a
`FieldSet` and mapping a `FieldSet` to a domain object. Because the input of a
`LineTokenizer` matches the input of the `LineMapper` (a line), and the output of a
`FieldSetMapper` matches the output of the `LineMapper`, a default implementation that
uses both a `LineTokenizer` and a `FieldSetMapper` is provided. The `DefaultLineMapper`,
shown in the following class definition, represents the behavior most users need:

[source, java]
----

public class DefaultLineMapper<T> implements LineMapper<>, InitializingBean {

    private LineTokenizer tokenizer;

    private FieldSetMapper<T> fieldSetMapper;

    public T mapLine(String line, int lineNumber) throws Exception {
        return fieldSetMapper.mapFieldSet(tokenizer.tokenize(line));
    }

    public void setLineTokenizer(LineTokenizer tokenizer) {
        this.tokenizer = tokenizer;
    }

    public void setFieldSetMapper(FieldSetMapper<T> fieldSetMapper) {
        this.fieldSetMapper = fieldSetMapper;
    }
}
----

The above functionality is provided in a default implementation, rather than being built
into the reader itself (as was done in previous versions of the framework) to allow users
greater flexibility in controlling the parsing process, especially if access to the raw
line is needed.

[[simpleDelimitedFileReadingExample]]
== Simple Delimited File Reading Example

The following example illustrates how to read a flat file with an actual domain scenario.
This particular batch job reads in football players from the following file:

----
ID,lastName,firstName,position,birthYear,debutYear
"AbduKa00,Abdul-Jabbar,Karim,rb,1974,1996",
"AbduRa00,Abdullah,Rabih,rb,1975,1999",
"AberWa00,Abercrombie,Walter,rb,1959,1982",
"AbraDa00,Abramowicz,Danny,wr,1945,1967",
"AdamBo00,Adams,Bob,te,1946,1969",
"AdamCh00,Adams,Charlie,wr,1979,2003"
----

The contents of this file are mapped to the following
`Player` domain object:

[source, java]
----
public class Player implements Serializable {

    private String ID;
    private String lastName;
    private String firstName;
    private String position;
    private int birthYear;
    private int debutYear;

    public String toString() {
        return "PLAYER:ID=" + ID + ",Last Name=" + lastName +
            ",First Name=" + firstName + ",Position=" + position +
            ",Birth Year=" + birthYear + ",DebutYear=" +
            debutYear;
    }

    // setters and getters...
}
----

To map a `FieldSet` into a `Player` object, a `FieldSetMapper` that returns players needs
to be defined, as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
protected static class PlayerFieldSetMapper implements FieldSetMapper<Player> {
    public Player mapFieldSet(FieldSet fieldSet) {
        Player player = new Player();

        player.setID(fieldSet.readString(0));
        player.setLastName(fieldSet.readString(1));
        player.setFirstName(fieldSet.readString(2));
        player.setPosition(fieldSet.readString(3));
        player.setBirthYear(fieldSet.readInt(4));
        player.setDebutYear(fieldSet.readInt(5));

        return player;
    }
}
----

The file can then be read by correctly constructing a `FlatFileItemReader` and calling
`read`, as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
FlatFileItemReader<Player> itemReader = new FlatFileItemReader<>();
itemReader.setResource(new FileSystemResource("resources/players.csv"));
DefaultLineMapper<Player> lineMapper = new DefaultLineMapper<>();
//DelimitedLineTokenizer defaults to comma as its delimiter
lineMapper.setLineTokenizer(new DelimitedLineTokenizer());
lineMapper.setFieldSetMapper(new PlayerFieldSetMapper());
itemReader.setLineMapper(lineMapper);
itemReader.open(new ExecutionContext());
Player player = itemReader.read();
----

Each call to `read` returns a new
        `Player` object from each line in the file. When the end of the file is
        reached, `null` is returned.

[[mappingFieldsByName]]
== Mapping Fields by Name

There is one additional piece of functionality that is allowed by both
`DelimitedLineTokenizer` and `FixedLengthTokenizer` and that is similar in function to a
JDBC `ResultSet`. The names of the fields can be injected into either of these
`LineTokenizer` implementations to increase the readability of the mapping function.
First, the column names of all fields in the flat file are injected into the tokenizer,
as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
tokenizer.setNames(new String[] {"ID", "lastName", "firstName", "position", "birthYear", "debutYear"});
----

A `FieldSetMapper` can use this information as follows:


[source, java]
----
public class PlayerMapper implements FieldSetMapper<Player> {
    public Player mapFieldSet(FieldSet fs) {

       if (fs == null) {
           return null;
       }

       Player player = new Player();
       player.setID(fs.readString("ID"));
       player.setLastName(fs.readString("lastName"));
       player.setFirstName(fs.readString("firstName"));
       player.setPosition(fs.readString("position"));
       player.setDebutYear(fs.readInt("debutYear"));
       player.setBirthYear(fs.readInt("birthYear"));

       return player;
   }
}
----

[[beanWrapperFieldSetMapper]]
== Automapping FieldSets to Domain Objects

For many, having to write a specific `FieldSetMapper` is equally as cumbersome as writing
a specific `RowMapper` for a `JdbcTemplate`. Spring Batch makes this easier by providing
a `FieldSetMapper` that automatically maps fields by matching a field name with a setter
on the object using the JavaBean specification.


[tabs]
====
Java::
+
Again using the football example, the `BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper` configuration looks like
the following snippet in Java:
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public FieldSetMapper fieldSetMapper() {
	BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper fieldSetMapper = new BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper();

	fieldSetMapper.setPrototypeBeanName("player");

	return fieldSetMapper;
}

@Bean
@Scope("prototype")
public Player player() {
	return new Player();
}
----

XML::
+
Again using the football example, the `BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper` configuration looks like
the following snippet in XML:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="fieldSetMapper"
      class="org.springframework.batch.item.file.mapping.BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper">
    <property name="prototypeBeanName" value="player" />
</bean>

<bean id="player"
      class="org.springframework.batch.sample.domain.Player"
      scope="prototype" />
----

====



For each entry in the `FieldSet`, the mapper looks for a corresponding setter on a new
instance of the `Player` object (for this reason, prototype scope is required) in the
same way the Spring container looks for setters matching a property name. Each available
field in the `FieldSet` is mapped, and the resultant `Player` object is returned, with no
code required.

[[fixedLengthFileFormats]]
== Fixed Length File Formats

So far, only delimited files have been discussed in much detail. However, they represent
only half of the file reading picture. Many organizations that use flat files use fixed
length formats. An example fixed length file follows:

----
UK21341EAH4121131.11customer1
UK21341EAH4221232.11customer2
UK21341EAH4321333.11customer3
UK21341EAH4421434.11customer4
UK21341EAH4521535.11customer5
----

While this looks like one large field, it actually represent 4 distinct fields:

. ISIN: Unique identifier for the item being ordered - 12 characters long.
. Quantity: Number of the item being ordered - 3 characters long.
. Price: Price of the item - 5 characters long.
. Customer: ID of the customer ordering the item - 9 characters long.

When configuring the `FixedLengthLineTokenizer`, each of these lengths must be provided
in the form of ranges.

	tokenizer.setNames("ISIN", "Quantity", "Price", "Customer");
	tokenizer.setColumns(new Range(1, 12),
						new Range(13, 15),
						new Range(16, 20),
						new Range(21, 29));

	return tokenizer;
}

    <property name="columns" value="1-12, 13-15, 16-20, 21-29" />
</bean>
----
+
Because the `FixedLengthLineTokenizer` uses the same `LineTokenizer` interface as
discussed earlier, it returns the same `FieldSet` as if a delimiter had been used. This
allows the same approaches to be used in handling its output, such as using the
`BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Supporting the preceding syntax for ranges requires that a specialized property editor,
`RangeArrayPropertyEditor`, be configured in the `ApplicationContext`. However, this bean
is automatically declared in an `ApplicationContext` where the batch namespace is used.

[[prefixMatchingLineMapper]]
== Multiple Record Types within a Single File

All of the file reading examples up to this point have all made a key assumption for
simplicity's sake: all of the records in a file have the same format. However, this may
not always be the case. It is very common that a file might have records with different
formats that need to be tokenized differently and mapped to different objects. The
following excerpt from a file illustrates this:

----
USER;Smith;Peter;;T;20014539;F
LINEA;1044391041ABC037.49G201XX1383.12H
LINEB;2134776319DEF422.99M005LI
----

In this file we have three types of records, "USER", "LINEA", and "LINEB". A "USER" line
corresponds to a `User` object. "LINEA" and "LINEB" both correspond to `Line` objects,
though a "LINEA" has more information than a "LINEB".

The `ItemReader` reads each line individually, but we must specify different
`LineTokenizer` and `FieldSetMapper` objects so that the `ItemWriter` receives the
correct items. The `PatternMatchingCompositeLineMapper` makes this easy by allowing maps
of patterns to `LineTokenizers` and patterns to `FieldSetMappers` to be configured.


[tabs]
====
Java::
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Bean
public PatternMatchingCompositeLineMapper orderFileLineMapper() {
	PatternMatchingCompositeLineMapper lineMapper =
		new PatternMatchingCompositeLineMapper();

	Map<String, LineTokenizer> tokenizers = new HashMap<>(3);
	tokenizers.put("USER*", userTokenizer());
	tokenizers.put("LINEA*", lineATokenizer());
	tokenizers.put("LINEB*", lineBTokenizer());

	lineMapper.setTokenizers(tokenizers);

	Map<String, FieldSetMapper> mappers = new HashMap<>(2);
	mappers.put("USER*", userFieldSetMapper());
	mappers.put("LINE*", lineFieldSetMapper());

	lineMapper.setFieldSetMappers(mappers);

	return lineMapper;
}
----

    <property name="tokenizers">

            <entry key="USER*" value-ref="userTokenizer" />
            <entry key="LINEA*" value-ref="lineATokenizer" />

            <entry key="LINE*" value-ref="lineFieldSetMapper" />
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>
----

====



In this example, "LINEA" and "LINEB" have separate `LineTokenizer` instances, but they both use
the same `FieldSetMapper`.

The `PatternMatchingCompositeLineMapper` uses the `PatternMatcher#match` method
in order to select the correct delegate for each line. The `PatternMatcher` allows for
two wildcard characters with special meaning: the question mark ("?") matches exactly one
character, while the asterisk ("\*") matches zero or more characters. Note that, in the
preceding configuration, all patterns end with an asterisk, making them effectively
prefixes  to lines. The `PatternMatcher` always matches the most specific pattern
possible, regardless of the order in the configuration. So if "LINE*" and "LINEA*" were
both listed as patterns, "LINEA" would match pattern "LINEA*", while "LINEB" would match
pattern "LINE*". Additionally, a single asterisk ("*") can serve as a default by matching
any line not matched by any other pattern.

There is also a `PatternMatchingCompositeLineTokenizer` that can be used for tokenization
alone.

It is also common for a flat file to contain records that each span multiple lines. To
handle this situation, a more complex strategy is required. A demonstration of this
common pattern can be found in the `multiLineRecords` sample.

[[exceptionHandlingInFlatFiles]]
== Exception Handling in Flat Files

There are many scenarios when tokenizing a line may cause exceptions to be thrown. Many
flat files are imperfect and contain incorrectly formatted records. Many users choose to
skip these erroneous lines while logging the issue, the original line, and the line
number. These logs can later be inspected manually or by another batch job. For this
reason, Spring Batch provides a hierarchy of exceptions for handling parse exceptions:
`FlatFileParseException` and `FlatFileFormatException`. `FlatFileParseException` is
thrown by the `FlatFileItemReader` when any errors are encountered while trying to read a
file. `FlatFileFormatException` is thrown by implementations of the `LineTokenizer`
interface and indicates a more specific error encountered while tokenizing.

[[incorrectTokenCountException]]
=== `IncorrectTokenCountException`

Both `DelimitedLineTokenizer` and `FixedLengthLineTokenizer` have the ability to specify
column names that can be used for creating a `FieldSet`. However, if the number of column
names does not match the number of columns found while tokenizing a line, the `FieldSet`
cannot be created, and an `IncorrectTokenCountException` is thrown, which contains the
number of tokens encountered, and the number expected, as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
tokenizer.setNames(new String[] {"A", "B", "C", "D"});

try {
    tokenizer.tokenize("a,b,c");
}
catch (IncorrectTokenCountException e) {
    assertEquals(4, e.getExpectedCount());
    assertEquals(3, e.getActualCount());
}
----

Because the tokenizer was configured with 4 column names but only 3 tokens were found in
the file, an `IncorrectTokenCountException` was thrown.

[[incorrectLineLengthException]]
=== `IncorrectLineLengthException`

Files formatted in a fixed-length format have additional requirements when parsing
because, unlike a delimited format, each column must strictly adhere to its predefined
width. If the total line length does not equal the widest value of this column, an
exception is thrown, as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
tokenizer.setColumns(new Range[] { new Range(1, 5),
                                   new Range(6, 10),
                                   new Range(11, 15) });
try {
    tokenizer.tokenize("12345");
    fail("Expected IncorrectLineLengthException");
}
catch (IncorrectLineLengthException ex) {
    assertEquals(15, ex.getExpectedLength());
    assertEquals(5, ex.getActualLength());
}
----

The configured ranges for the tokenizer above are: 1-5, 6-10, and 11-15. Consequently,
the total length of the line is 15. However, in the preceding example, a line of length 5
was passed in, causing an `IncorrectLineLengthException` to be thrown. Throwing an
exception here rather than only mapping the first column allows the processing of the
line to fail earlier and with more information than it would contain if it failed while
trying to read in column 2 in a `FieldSetMapper`. However, there are scenarios where the
length of the line is not always constant. For this reason, validation of line length can
be turned off via the 'strict' property, as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
tokenizer.setColumns(new Range[] { new Range(1, 5), new Range(6, 10) });
tokenizer.setStrict(false);
FieldSet tokens = tokenizer.tokenize("12345");
assertEquals("12345", tokens.readString(0));
assertEquals("", tokens.readString(1));
----

The preceding example is almost identical to the one before it, except that
`tokenizer.setStrict(false)` was called. This setting tells the tokenizer to not enforce
line lengths when tokenizing the line. A `FieldSet` is now correctly created and
returned. However, it contains only empty tokens for the remaining values.
