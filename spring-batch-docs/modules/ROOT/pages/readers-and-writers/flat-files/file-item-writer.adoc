[[flatFileItemWriter]]
= `FlatFileItemWriter`

Writing out to flat files has the same problems and issues that reading in from a file
must overcome. A step must be able to write either delimited or fixed length formats in a
transactional manner.

[[lineAggregator]]
== `LineAggregator`

Just as the `LineTokenizer` interface is necessary to take an item and turn it into a
`String`, file writing must have a way to aggregate multiple fields into a single string
for writing to a file. In Spring Batch, this is the `LineAggregator`, shown in the
following interface definition:

[source, java]
----
public interface LineAggregator<T> {

    public String aggregate(T item);

}
----

The `LineAggregator` is the logical opposite of `LineTokenizer`.  `LineTokenizer` takes a
`String` and returns a `FieldSet`, whereas `LineAggregator` takes an `item` and returns a
`String`.

[[PassThroughLineAggregator]]
=== `PassThroughLineAggregator`

The most basic implementation of the `LineAggregator` interface is the
`PassThroughLineAggregator`, which assumes that the object is already a string or that
its string representation is acceptable for writing, as shown in the following code:

[source, java]
----
public class PassThroughLineAggregator<T> implements LineAggregator<T> {

    public String aggregate(T item) {
        return item.toString();
    }
}
----

The preceding implementation is useful if direct control of creating the string is
required but the advantages of a `FlatFileItemWriter`, such as transaction and restart
support, are necessary.

[[SimplifiedFileWritingExample]]
== Simplified File Writing Example

Now that the `LineAggregator` interface and its most basic implementation,
`PassThroughLineAggregator`, have been defined, the basic flow of writing can be
explained:

. The object to be written is passed to the `LineAggregator` in order to obtain a
`String`.
. The returned `String` is written to the configured file.

The following excerpt from the `FlatFileItemWriter` expresses this in code:

[source, java]
----
public void write(T item) throws Exception {
    write(lineAggregator.aggregate(item) + LINE_SEPARATOR);
}
----

[[FieldExtractor]]
== `FieldExtractor`

The preceding example may be useful for the most basic uses of a writing to a file.
However, most users of the `FlatFileItemWriter` have a domain object that needs to be
written out and, thus, must be converted into a line. In file reading, the following was
required:

. Read one line from the file.
. Pass the line into the `LineTokenizer#tokenize()` method, in order to retrieve a
`FieldSet`.
. Pass the `FieldSet` returned from tokenizing to a `FieldSetMapper`, returning the
result from the `ItemReader#read()` method.

File writing has similar but inverse steps:

. Pass the item to be written to the writer.
. Convert the fields on the item into an array.
. Aggregate the resulting array into a line.

Because there is no way for the framework to know which fields from the object need to
be written out, a `FieldExtractor` must be written to accomplish the task of turning the
item into an array, as shown in the following interface definition:

[source, java]
----
public interface FieldExtractor<T> {

    Object[] extract(T item);

}
----

Implementations of the `FieldExtractor` interface should create an array from the fields
of the provided object, which can then be written out with a delimiter between the
elements or as part of a fixed-width line.

[[PassThroughFieldExtractor]]
=== `PassThroughFieldExtractor`

There are many cases where a collection, such as an array, `Collection`, or `FieldSet`,
needs to be written out. "Extracting" an array from one of these collection types is very
straightforward. To do so, convert the collection to an array. Therefore, the
`PassThroughFieldExtractor` should be used in this scenario. It should be noted that, if
the object passed in is not a type of collection, then the `PassThroughFieldExtractor`
returns an array containing solely the item to be extracted.

[[BeanWrapperFieldExtractor]]
=== `BeanWrapperFieldExtractor`

As with the `BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper` described in the file reading section, it is
often preferable to configure how to convert a domain object to an object array, rather
than writing the conversion yourself. The `BeanWrapperFieldExtractor` provides this
functionality, as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
BeanWrapperFieldExtractor<Name> extractor = new BeanWrapperFieldExtractor<>();
extractor.setNames(new String[] { "first", "last", "born" });

String first = "Alan";
String last = "Turing";
int born = 1912;

Name n = new Name(first, last, born);
Object[] values = extractor.extract(n);

assertEquals(first, values[0]);
assertEquals(last, values[1]);
assertEquals(born, values[2]);
----

This extractor implementation has only one required property: the names of the fields to
map. Just as the `BeanWrapperFieldSetMapper` needs field names to map fields on the
`FieldSet` to setters on the provided object, the `BeanWrapperFieldExtractor` needs names
to map to getters for creating an object array. It is worth noting that the order of the
names determines the order of the fields within the array.

[[delimitedFileWritingExample]]
== Delimited File Writing Example

The most basic flat file format is one in which all fields are separated by a delimiter.
This can be accomplished using a `DelimitedLineAggregator`. The following example writes
out a simple domain object that represents a credit to a customer account:

[source, java]
----
public class CustomerCredit {

    private int id;
    private String name;
    private BigDecimal credit;

    //getters and setters removed for clarity
}
----

Because a domain object is being used, an implementation of the `FieldExtractor`
interface must be provided, along with the delimiter to use.

	DelimitedLineAggregator<CustomerCredit> lineAggregator = new DelimitedLineAggregator<>();
	lineAggregator.setDelimiter(",");
	lineAggregator.setFieldExtractor(fieldExtractor);

            </property>
        </bean>
    </property>
</bean>

In the previous example, the `BeanWrapperFieldExtractor` described earlier in this
chapter is used to turn the name and credit fields within `CustomerCredit` into an object
array, which is then written out with commas between each field.

[[fixedWidthFileWritingExample]]
== Fixed Width File Writing Example

Delimited is not the only type of flat file format. Many prefer to use a set width for
each column to delineate between fields, which is usually referred to as 'fixed width'.
Spring Batch supports this in file writing with the `FormatterLineAggregator`.

`Formatter` is based on the

[[handlingFileCreation]]
== Handling File Creation

`FlatFileItemReader` has a very simple relationship with file resources. When the reader
is initialized, it opens the file (if it exists), and throws an exception if it does not.
File writing isn't quite so simple. At first glance, it seems like a similar
straightforward contract should exist for `FlatFileItemWriter`: If the file already
exists, throw an exception, and, if it does not, create it and start writing. However,
potentially restarting a `Job` can cause issues. In normal restart scenarios, the
contract is reversed: If the file exists, start writing to it from the last known good
position, and, if it does not, throw an exception. However, what happens if the file name
for this job is always the same? In this case, you would want to delete the file if it
exists, unless it's a restart. Because of this possibility, the `FlatFileItemWriter`
contains the property, `shouldDeleteIfExists`. Setting this property to true causes an
existing file with the same name to be deleted when the writer is opened.
