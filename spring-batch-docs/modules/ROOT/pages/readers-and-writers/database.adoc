[[database]]
= Database

Like most enterprise application styles, a database is the central storage mechanism for
batch. However, batch differs from other application styles due to the sheer size of the
datasets with which the system must work. If a SQL statement returns 1 million rows, the
result set probably holds all returned results in memory until all rows have been read.
Spring Batch provides two types of solutions for this problem:

* xref:readers-and-writers/database.adoc#cursorBasedItemReaders[Cursor-based `ItemReader` Implementations]
* xref:readers-and-writers/database.adoc#pagingItemReaders[Paging `ItemReader` Implementations]

[[cursorBasedItemReaders]]
== Cursor-based `ItemReader` Implementations

Using a database cursor is generally the default approach of most batch developers,
because it is the database's solution to the problem of 'streaming' relational data. The
Java `ResultSet` class is essentially an object oriented mechanism for manipulating a
cursor. A `ResultSet` maintains a cursor to the current row of data. Calling `next` on a
`ResultSet` moves this cursor to the next row. The Spring Batch cursor-based `ItemReader`
implementation opens a cursor on initialization and moves the cursor forward one row for
every call to `read`, returning a mapped object that can be used for processing. The
`close` method is then called to ensure all resources are freed up. The Spring core
`JdbcTemplate` gets around this problem by using the callback pattern to completely map
all rows in a `ResultSet` and close before returning control back to the method caller.
However, in batch, this must wait until the step is complete. The following image shows a
generic diagram of how a cursor-based `ItemReader` works. Note that, while the example
uses SQL (because SQL is so widely known), any technology could implement the basic
approach.

.Cursor Example
image::cursorExample.png[Cursor Example, scaledwidth="60%"]

This example illustrates the basic pattern. Given a 'FOO' table, which has three columns:
`ID`, `NAME`, and `BAR`, select all rows with an ID greater than 1 but less than 7. This
puts the beginning of the cursor (row 1) on ID 2. The result of this row should be a
completely mapped `Foo` object. Calling `read()` again moves the cursor to the next row,
which is the `Foo` with an ID of 3. The results of these reads are written out after each
`read`, allowing the objects to be garbage collected (assuming no instance variables are
maintaining references to them).

[[JdbcCursorItemReader]]
=== `JdbcCursorItemReader`

`JdbcCursorItemReader` is the JDBC implementation of the cursor-based technique. It works
directly with a `ResultSet` and requires an SQL statement to run against a connection
obtained from a `DataSource`. The following database schema is used as an example:

[source, sql]
----
CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER (
   ID BIGINT IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
   NAME VARCHAR(45),
   CREDIT FLOAT
);
----

Many people prefer to use a domain object for each row, so the following example uses an
implementation of the `RowMapper` interface to map a `CustomerCredit` object:

[source, java]
----
public class CustomerCreditRowMapper implements RowMapper<CustomerCredit> {

    public static final String ID_COLUMN = "id";
    public static final String NAME_COLUMN = "name";
    public static final String CREDIT_COLUMN = "credit";

    public CustomerCredit mapRow(ResultSet rs, int rowNum) throws SQLException {
        CustomerCredit customerCredit = new CustomerCredit();

        customerCredit.setId(rs.getInt(ID_COLUMN));
        customerCredit.setName(rs.getString(NAME_COLUMN));
        customerCredit.setCredit(rs.getBigDecimal(CREDIT_COLUMN));

        return customerCredit;
    }
}
----

Because `JdbcCursorItemReader` shares key interfaces with `JdbcTemplate`, it is useful to
see an example of how to read in this data with `JdbcTemplate`, in order to contrast it
with the `ItemReader`. For the purposes of this example, assume there are 1,000 rows in
the `CUSTOMER` database. The first example uses `JdbcTemplate`:

[source, java]
----
//For simplicity sake, assume a dataSource has already been obtained
JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate = new JdbcTemplate(dataSource);
List customerCredits = jdbcTemplate.query("SELECT ID, NAME, CREDIT from CUSTOMER",
                                          new CustomerCreditRowMapper());
----

After running the preceding code snippet, the `customerCredits` list contains 1,000
`CustomerCredit` objects. In the query method, a connection is obtained from the
`DataSource`, the provided SQL is run against it, and the `mapRow` method is called for
each row in the `ResultSet`. Contrast this with the approach of the
`JdbcCursorItemReader`, shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
JdbcCursorItemReader itemReader = new JdbcCursorItemReader();
itemReader.setDataSource(dataSource);
itemReader.setSql("SELECT ID, NAME, CREDIT from CUSTOMER");
itemReader.setRowMapper(new CustomerCreditRowMapper());
int counter = 0;
ExecutionContext executionContext = new ExecutionContext();
itemReader.open(executionContext);
Object customerCredit = new Object();
while(customerCredit != null){
    customerCredit = itemReader.read();
    counter++;
}
itemReader.close();
----

After running the preceding code snippet, the counter equals 1,000. If the code above had
put the returned `customerCredit` into a list, the result would have been exactly the
same as with the `JdbcTemplate` example. However, the big advantage of the `ItemReader`
is that it allows items to be 'streamed'. The `read` method can be called once, the item
can be written out by an `ItemWriter`, and then the next item can be obtained with
`read`. This allows item reading and writing to be done in 'chunks' and committed
periodically, which is the essence of high performance batch processing. Furthermore, it
is  easily configured for injection into a Spring Batch `Step`.

[[JdbcCursorItemReaderProperties]]
==== Additional Properties

Because there are so many varying options for opening a cursor in Java, there are many
properties on the `JdbcCursorItemReader` that can be set, as described in the following
table:

.JdbcCursorItemReader Properties

|===============
|ignoreWarnings|Determines whether or not SQLWarnings are logged or cause an exception.
The default is `true` (meaning that warnings are logged).
|fetchSize|Gives the JDBC driver a hint as to the number of rows that should be fetched
from the database when more rows are needed by the `ResultSet` object used by the
`ItemReader`. By default, no hint is given.
|maxRows|Sets the limit for the maximum number of rows the underlying `ResultSet` can
hold at any one time.
|queryTimeout|Sets the number of seconds the driver waits for a `Statement` object to
run. If the limit is exceeded, a `DataAccessException` is thrown. (Consult your driver
vendor documentation for details).
|verifyCursorPosition|Because the same `ResultSet` held by the `ItemReader` is passed to
the `RowMapper`, it is possible for users to call `ResultSet.next()` themselves, which
could cause issues with the reader's internal count. Setting this value to `true` causes
an exception to be thrown if the cursor position is not the same after the `RowMapper`
call as it was before.
|saveState|Indicates whether or not the reader's state should be saved in the
`ExecutionContext` provided by `ItemStream#update(ExecutionContext)`. The default is
`true`.
|driverSupportsAbsolute|Indicates whether the JDBC driver supports
setting the absolute row on a `ResultSet`. It is recommended that this is set to `true`
for JDBC drivers that support `ResultSet.absolute()`, as it may improve performance,
especially if a step fails while working with a large data set. Defaults to `false`.
|setUseSharedExtendedConnection| Indicates whether the connection
used for the cursor should be used by all other processing, thus sharing the same
transaction. If this is set to `false`, then the cursor is opened with its own connection
and does not participate in any transactions started for the rest of the step processing.
If you set this flag to `true` then you must wrap the DataSource in an
`ExtendedConnectionDataSourceProxy` to prevent the connection from being closed and
released after each commit. When you set this option to `true`, the statement used to
open the cursor is created with both 'READ_ONLY' and 'HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT' options.
This allows holding the cursor open over transaction start and commits performed in the
step processing. To use this feature, you need a database that supports this and a JDBC
driver supporting JDBC 3.0 or later. Defaults to `false`.
|===============


[[StoredProcedureItemReader]]
=== `StoredProcedureItemReader`

Sometimes it is necessary to obtain the cursor data by using a stored procedure. The
`StoredProcedureItemReader` works like the `JdbcCursorItemReader`, except that, instead
of running a query to obtain a cursor, it runs a stored procedure that returns a cursor.
The stored procedure can return the cursor in three different ways:


* As a returned `ResultSet` (used by SQL Server, Sybase, DB2, Derby, and MySQL).
* As a ref-cursor returned as an out parameter (used by Oracle and PostgreSQL).
* As the return value of a stored function call.

public StoredProcedureItemReader reader(DataSource dataSource) {
	StoredProcedureItemReader reader = new StoredProcedureItemReader();

	reader.setDataSource(dataSource);
	reader.setProcedureName("sp_customer_credit");
	reader.setRowMapper(new CustomerCreditRowMapper());

	return reader;
}
----
//TODO: Fix the above config to use a builder once we have one for it.

    </property>
</bean>

The preceding example relies on the stored procedure to provide a `ResultSet` as a
returned result (option 1 from earlier).

If the stored procedure returned a `ref-cursor` (option 2), then we would need to provide
the position of the out parameter that is the returned `ref-cursor`.

    <property name="rowMapper">
        <bean class="org.springframework.batch.samples.domain.CustomerCreditRowMapper"/>
    </property>
</bean>

If the cursor was returned from a stored function (option 3), we would need to set the
property "[maroon]#function#" to `true`. It defaults to `false`.

    </property>
</bean>

====



In all of these cases, we need to define a `RowMapper` as well as a `DataSource` and the
actual procedure name.

If the stored procedure or function takes in parameters, then they must be declared and
set by using the `parameters` property. The following example, for Oracle, declares three
parameters. The first one is the `out` parameter that returns the ref-cursor, and the
second and third are in parameters that takes a value of type `INTEGER`.

In addition to the parameter declarations, we need to specify a `PreparedStatementSetter`
implementation that sets the parameter values for the call. This works the same as for
the `JdbcCursorItemReader` above. All the additional properties listed in
xref:readers-and-writers/database.adoc#JdbcCursorItemReaderProperties[Additional Properties] apply to the `StoredProcedureItemReader` as well.

[[pagingItemReaders]]
== Paging `ItemReader` Implementations

An alternative to using a database cursor is running multiple queries where each query
fetches a portion of the results. We refer to this portion as a page. Each query must
specify the starting row number and the number of rows that we want returned in the page.

[[JdbcPagingItemReader]]
=== `JdbcPagingItemReader`

One implementation of a paging `ItemReader` is the `JdbcPagingItemReader`. The
`JdbcPagingItemReader` needs a `PagingQueryProvider` responsible for providing the SQL
queries used to retrieve the rows making up a page. Since each database has its own
strategy for providing paging support, we need to use a different `PagingQueryProvider`
for each supported database type. There is also the `SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean`
that auto-detects the database that is being used and determine the appropriate
`PagingQueryProvider` implementation. This simplifies the configuration and is the
recommended best practice.

The `SqlPagingQueryProviderFactoryBean` requires that you specify a `select` clause and a
`from` clause. You can also provide an optional `where` clause. These clauses and the
required `sortKey` are used to build an SQL statement.

NOTE: It is important to have a unique key constraint on the `sortKey` to guarantee that
 no data is lost between executions.

After the reader has been opened, it passes back one item per call to `read` in the same
basic fashion as any other `ItemReader`. The paging happens behind the scenes when
additional rows are needed.

    <property name="rowMapper" ref="customerMapper"/>
</bean>
----

====



This configured `ItemReader` returns `CustomerCredit` objects using the `RowMapper`,
which must be specified. The 'pageSize' property determines the number of entities read
from the database for each query run.

The 'parameterValues' property can be used to specify a `Map` of parameter values for the
query. If you use named parameters in the `where` clause, the key for each entry should
match the name of the named parameter. If you use a traditional '?' placeholder, then the
key for each entry should be the number of the placeholder, starting with 1.

[[JpaPagingItemReader]]
=== `JpaPagingItemReader`

Another implementation of a paging `ItemReader` is the `JpaPagingItemReader`. JPA does
not have a concept similar to the Hibernate `StatelessSession`, so we have to use other
features provided by the JPA specification. Since JPA supports paging, this is a natural
choice when it comes to using JPA for batch processing. After each page is read, the
entities become detached and the persistence context is cleared, to allow the entities to
be garbage collected once the page is processed.

The `JpaPagingItemReader` lets you declare a JPQL statement and pass in a
`EntityManagerFactory`. It then passes back one item per call to read in the same basic
fashion as any other `ItemReader`. The paging happens behind the scenes when additional
entities are needed.

This configured `ItemReader` returns `CustomerCredit` objects in the exact same manner as
described for the `JdbcPagingItemReader` above, assuming the `CustomerCredit` object has the
correct JPA annotations or ORM mapping file. The 'pageSize' property determines the
number of entities read from the database for each query execution.

[[databaseItemWriters]]
== Database ItemWriters

While both flat files and XML files have a specific `ItemWriter` instance, there is no exact equivalent
in the database world. This is because transactions provide all the needed functionality.
`ItemWriter` implementations are necessary for files because they must act as if they're transactional,
keeping track of written items and flushing or clearing at the appropriate times.
Databases have no need for this functionality, since the write is already contained in a
transaction. Users can create their own DAOs that implement the `ItemWriter` interface or
use one from a custom `ItemWriter` that's written for generic processing concerns. Either
way, they should work without any issues. One thing to look out for is the performance
and error handling capabilities that are provided by batching the outputs. This is most
common when using hibernate as an `ItemWriter` but could have the same issues when using
JDBC batch mode. Batching database output does not have any inherent flaws, assuming we
are careful to flush and there are no errors in the data. However, any errors while
writing can cause confusion, because there is no way to know which individual item caused
an exception or even if any individual item was responsible, as illustrated in the
following image:

.Error On Flush
image::errorOnFlush.png[Error On Flush, scaledwidth="60%"]

If items are buffered before being written, any errors are not thrown until the buffer is
flushed just before a commit. For example, assume that 20 items are written per chunk,
and the 15th item throws a `DataIntegrityViolationException`. As far as the `Step`
is concerned, all 20 item are written successfully, since there is no way to know that an
error occurs until they are actually written. Once `Session#flush()` is called, the
buffer is emptied and the exception is hit. At this point, there is nothing the `Step`
can do. The transaction must be rolled back. Normally, this exception might cause the
item to be skipped (depending upon the skip/retry policies), and then it is not written
again. However, in the batched scenario, there is no way to know which item caused the
issue. The whole buffer was being written when the failure happened. The only way to
solve this issue is to flush after each item, as shown in the following image:

.Error On Write
image::errorOnWrite.png[Error On Write, scaledwidth="60%"]

This is a common use case, especially when using Hibernate, and the simple guideline for
implementations of `ItemWriter` is to flush on each call to `write()`. Doing so allows
for items to be skipped reliably, with Spring Batch internally taking care of the
granularity of the calls to `ItemWriter` after an error.
