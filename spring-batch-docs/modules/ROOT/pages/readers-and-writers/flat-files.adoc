= Flat Files

One of the most common mechanisms for interchanging bulk data has always been the flat
file. Unlike XML, which has an agreed upon standard for defining how it is structured
(XSD), anyone reading a flat file must understand ahead of time exactly how the file is
structured. In general, all flat files fall into two types: delimited and fixed length.
Delimited files are those in which fields are separated by a delimiter, such as a comma.
Fixed Length files have fields that are a set length.
