[[jsonReadingWriting]]
= JSON Item Readers And Writers

Spring Batch provides support for reading and Writing JSON resources in the following format:

[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "isin": "123",
    "quantity": 1,
    "price": 1.2,
    "customer": "foo"
  },
  {
    "isin": "456",
    "quantity": 2,
    "price": 1.4,
    "customer": "bar"
  }
]
----

It is assumed that the JSON resource is an array of JSON objects corresponding to
individual items. Spring Batch is not tied to any particular JSON library.

[[JsonItemReader]]
== `JsonItemReader`

The `JsonItemReader` delegates JSON parsing and binding to implementations of the
`org.springframework.batch.item.json.JsonObjectReader` interface. This interface
is intended to be implemented by using a streaming API to read JSON objects
in chunks. Two implementations are currently provided:

* link:$$https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson$$[Jackson] through the `org.springframework.batch.item.json.JacksonJsonObjectReader`
* link:$$https://github.com/google/gson$$[Gson] through the `org.springframework.batch.item.json.GsonJsonObjectReader`

To be able to process JSON records, the following is needed:

* `Resource`: A Spring Resource that represents the JSON file to read.
* `JsonObjectReader`: A JSON object reader to parse and bind JSON objects to items

The following example shows how to define a `JsonItemReader` that works with the
previous JSON resource `org/springframework/batch/item/json/trades.json` and a
`JsonObjectReader` based on Jackson:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public JsonItemReader<Trade> jsonItemReader() {
   return new JsonItemReaderBuilder<Trade>()
                 .jsonObjectReader(new JacksonJsonObjectReader<>(Trade.class))
                 .resource(new ClassPathResource("trades.json"))
                 .name("tradeJsonItemReader")
                 .build();
}
----

[[jsonfileitemwriter]]
== `JsonFileItemWriter`

The `JsonFileItemWriter` delegates the marshalling of items to the
`org.springframework.batch.item.json.JsonObjectMarshaller` interface. The contract
of this interface is to take an object and marshall it to a JSON `String`.
Two implementations are currently provided:

* link:$$https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson$$[Jackson] through the `org.springframework.batch.item.json.JacksonJsonObjectMarshaller`
* link:$$https://github.com/google/gson$$[Gson] through the `org.springframework.batch.item.json.GsonJsonObjectMarshaller`

To be able to write JSON records, the following is needed:

* `Resource`: A Spring `Resource` that represents the JSON file to write
* `JsonObjectMarshaller`: A JSON object marshaller to marshall objects to JSON format

The following example shows how to define a `JsonFileItemWriter`:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public JsonFileItemWriter<Trade> jsonFileItemWriter() {
   return new JsonFileItemWriterBuilder<Trade>()
                 .jsonObjectMarshaller(new JacksonJsonObjectMarshaller<>())
                 .resource(new ClassPathResource("trades.json"))
                 .name("tradeJsonFileItemWriter")
                 .build();
}
