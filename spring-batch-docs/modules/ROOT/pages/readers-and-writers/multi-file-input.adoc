[[multiFileInput]]
= Multi-File Input

It is a common requirement to process multiple files within a single `Step`. Assuming the
files all have the same formatting, the `MultiResourceItemReader` supports this type of
input for both XML and flat file processing. Consider the following files in a directory:

----
file-1.txt  file-2.txt  ignored.txt
----

file-1.txt and file-2.txt are formatted the same and, for business reasons, should be
processed together. The `MultiResourceItemReader` can be used to read in both files by
using wildcards.

</bean>

The referenced delegate is a simple `FlatFileItemReader`. The above configuration reads
input from both files, handling rollback and restart scenarios. It should be noted that,
as with any `ItemReader`, adding extra input (in this case a file) could cause potential
issues when restarting. It is recommended that batch jobs work with their own individual
directories until completed successfully.

NOTE: Input resources are ordered by using `MultiResourceItemReader#setComparator(Comparator)`
 to make sure resource ordering is preserved between job runs in restart scenario.
