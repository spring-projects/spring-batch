= Launching Batch Jobs through Messages

When starting batch jobs by using the core Spring Batch API, you
basically have two options:

* From the command line, with the `CommandLineJobRunner`
* Programmatically, with either `JobOperator.start()` or `JobLauncher.run()`

For example, you may want to use the
`CommandLineJobRunner` when invoking batch jobs by
using a shell script. Alternatively, you can use the
`JobOperator` directly (for example, when using
Spring Batch as part of a web application). However, what about
more complex use cases? Maybe you need to poll a remote (S)FTP
server to retrieve the data for the Batch Job or your application
has to support multiple different data sources simultaneously. For
example, you may receive data files not only from the web but also from
FTP and other sources. Maybe additional transformation of the input files is
needed before invoking Spring Batch.

Therefore, it would be much more powerful to execute the batch job
by using Spring Integration and its numerous adapters. For example,
you can use a _File Inbound Channel Adapter_ to
monitor a directory in the file-system and start the batch job as
soon as the input file arrives. Additionally, you can create Spring
Integration flows that use multiple different adapters to easily
ingest data for your batch jobs from multiple sources
simultaneously by using only configuration. Implementing all these
scenarios with Spring Integration is easy, as it allows for
decoupled, event-driven execution of the
`JobLauncher`.

Spring Batch Integration provides the
`JobLaunchingMessageHandler` class that you can
use to launch batch jobs. The input for the
`JobLaunchingMessageHandler` is provided by a
Spring Integration message, which has a payload of type
`JobLaunchRequest`. This class is a wrapper around the `Job`
to be launched and around the `JobParameters` that are
necessary to launch the Batch job.

The following image shows the typical Spring Integration
message flow that is needed to start a Batch job. The
link:$$https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/toc.html$$[EIP (Enterprise Integration Patterns) website]
provides a full overview of messaging icons and their descriptions.

[[transforming-a-file-into-a-joblaunchrequest]]
== Transforming a File into a JobLaunchRequest

The following example transforms a file into a `JobLaunchRequest`:

[source, java]
----
package io.spring.sbi;

import org.springframework.batch.core.Job;
import org.springframework.batch.core.JobParametersBuilder;
import org.springframework.batch.integration.launch.JobLaunchRequest;
import org.springframework.integration.annotation.Transformer;
import org.springframework.messaging.Message;

import java.io.File;

public class FileMessageToJobRequest {
    private Job job;
    private String fileParameterName;

    public void setFileParameterName(String fileParameterName) {
        this.fileParameterName = fileParameterName;
    }

    public void setJob(Job job) {
        this.job = job;
    }

    @Transformer
    public JobLaunchRequest toRequest(Message<File> message) {
        JobParametersBuilder jobParametersBuilder =
            new JobParametersBuilder();

        jobParametersBuilder.addString(fileParameterName,
            message.getPayload().getAbsolutePath());

        return new JobLaunchRequest(job, jobParametersBuilder.toJobParameters());
    }
}

[[the-jobexecution-response]]
== The JobExecution Response

When a batch job is being executed, a
`JobExecution` instance is returned. You can use this
instance to determine the status of an execution. If
a `JobExecution` is able to be created
successfully, it is always returned, regardless of whether
or not the actual execution is successful.

The exact behavior on how the `JobExecution`
instance is returned depends on the provided
`TaskExecutor`. If a
`synchronous` (single-threaded)
`TaskExecutor` implementation is used, the
`JobExecution` response is returned only
`after` the job completes. When using an
`asynchronous`
`TaskExecutor`, the
`JobExecution` instance is returned
immediately. You can then take the `id` of
`JobExecution` instance
(with `JobExecution.getJobId()`) and query the
`JobRepository` for the job's updated status
using the `JobExplorer`. For more
information, see
xref:job/advanced-meta-data.adoc#queryingRepository[Querying the Repository].

[[spring-batch-integration-configuration]]
== Spring Batch Integration Configuration

Consider a case where someone needs to create a file `inbound-channel-adapter` to listen
for CSV files in the provided directory, hand them off to a transformer
(`FileMessageToJobRequest`), launch the job through the job launching gateway, and
log the output of the `JobExecution` with the `logging-channel-adapter`.

[[example-itemreader-configuration]]
== Example ItemReader Configuration

Now that we are polling for files and launching jobs, we need to configure our Spring
Batch `ItemReader` (for example) to use the files found at the location defined by the job
parameter called "input.file.name", as the following bean configuration shows:


[tabs]

Java::
+
The following Java example shows the necessary bean configuration:
+
.Java Configuration
[source, java]
----
@Bean
@StepScope
public ItemReader sampleReader(@Value("#{jobParameters[input.file.name]}") String resource) {
...
    FlatFileItemReader flatFileItemReader = new FlatFileItemReader();
    flatFileItemReader.setResource(new FileSystemResource(resource));
...
    return flatFileItemReader;
}
----

XML::
+
The following XML example shows the necessary bean configuration:
+
.XML Configuration
[source, xml]
----
<bean id="itemReader" class="org.springframework.batch.item.file.FlatFileItemReader"
    scope="step">
  <property name="resource" value="file://#{jobParameters['input.file.name']}"/>
    ...
</bean>
----

====

The main points of interest in the preceding example are injecting the value of
`#{jobParameters['input.file.name']}`
as the Resource property value and setting the `ItemReader` bean
to have step scope. Setting the bean to have step scope takes advantage of
the late binding support, which allows access to the
`jobParameters` variable.
