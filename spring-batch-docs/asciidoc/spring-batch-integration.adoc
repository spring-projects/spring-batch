=== Spring Batch Integration Introduction

Many users of Spring Batch may encounter requirements that are
outside the scope of Spring Batch but that may be efficiently and
concisely implemented by using Spring Integration. Conversely, Spring
Integration users may encounter Spring Batch requirements and need a way
to efficiently integrate both frameworks. In this context, several
patterns and use-cases emerge, and Spring Batch Integration
addresses those requirements.

The line between Spring Batch and Spring Integration is not always
clear, but two pieces of advice can
help: Think about granularity, and apply common patterns. Some
of those common patterns are described in this reference manual
section.

Adding messaging to a batch process enables automation of
operations and also separation and strategizing of key concerns.
For example, a message might trigger a job to execute, and then the
sending of the message can be exposed in a variety of ways. Alternatively, when
a job completes or fails, that event might trigger a message to be sent,
and the consumers of those messages might have operational concerns
that have nothing to do with the application itself. Messaging can
also be embedded in a job (for example reading or writing items for
processing via channels). Remote partitioning and remote chunking
provide methods to distribute workloads over a number of workers.

This section covers the following key concepts:

[[namespace-support]]
[role="xmlContent"]
==== Namespace Support

Since Spring Batch Integration 1.3, dedicated XML Namespace
support was added, with the aim to provide an easier configuration
experience. In order to activate the namespace, add the following
namespace declarations to your Spring XML Application Context
file:

[source, xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:batch-int="http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration"
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration/spring-batch-integration.xsd">

    ...

</beans>
----

A fully configured Spring XML Application Context file for Spring
Batch Integration may look like the following:

[source, xml]
----
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns:int="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration"
  xmlns:batch="http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch"
  xmlns:batch-int="http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration"
  xsi:schemaLocation="
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/batch-integration/spring-batch-integration.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/batch/spring-batch.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration
    https://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/spring-integration.xsd">

    ...

</beans>
----

Appending version numbers to the referenced XSD file is also
allowed, but, as a version-less declaration always uses the
latest schema, we generally do not recommend appending the version
number to the XSD name. Adding a version number
could possibly create issues when updating the Spring Batch
Integration dependencies, as they may require more recent versions
of the XML schema.


[[launching-batch-jobs-through-messages]]

==== Launching Batch Jobs through Messages


When starting batch jobs by using the core Spring Batch API, you
basically have 2 options:

* From the command line, with the `CommandLineJobRunner`
* Programmatically, with either `JobOperator.start()` or `JobLauncher.run()`



For example, you may want to use the
`CommandLineJobRunner` when invoking Batch Jobs by
using a shell script. Alternatively, you may use the
`JobOperator` directly (for example, when using
Spring Batch as part of a web application). However, what about
more complex use cases? Maybe you need to poll a remote (S)FTP
server to retrieve the data for the Batch Job or your application
has to support multiple different data sources simultaneously. For
example, you may receive data files not only from the web, but also from
FTP and other sources. Maybe additional transformation of the input files is
needed before invoking Spring Batch.



Therefore, it would be much more powerful to execute the batch job
using Spring Integration and its numerous adapters. For example,
you can use a __File Inbound Channel Adapter__ to
monitor a directory in the file-system and start the Batch Job as
soon as the input file arrives. Additionally, you can create Spring
Integration flows that use multiple different adapters to easily
ingest data for your batch jobs from multiple sources
simultaneously using only configuration. Implementing all these
scenarios with Spring Integration is easy, as it allows for
decoupled, event-driven execution of the
`JobLauncher`.



Spring Batch Integration provides the
`JobLaunchingMessageHandler` class that you can
use to launch batch jobs. The input for the
`JobLaunchingMessageHandler` is provided by a
Spring Integration message, which has a payload of type
`JobLaunchRequest`. This class is a wrapper around the `Job`
    that needs to be launched and around the `JobParameters`
necessary to launch the Batch job.



The following image illustrates the typical Spring Integration
message flow in order to start a Batch job. The
link:$$https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/toc.html$$[EIP (Enterprise Integration Patterns) website]
provides a full overview of messaging icons and their descriptions.

[[the-jobexecution-response]]

===== The `JobExecution` Response

When a batch job is being executed, a
`JobExecution` instance is returned. This
instance can be used to determine the status of an execution. If
a `JobExecution` is able to be created
successfully, it is always returned, regardless of whether
or not the actual execution is successful.



The exact behavior on how the `JobExecution`
instance is returned depends on the provided
`TaskExecutor`. If a
`synchronous` (single-threaded)
`TaskExecutor` implementation is used, the
`JobExecution` response is returned only
`after` the job completes. When using an
`asynchronous`
`TaskExecutor`, the
`JobExecution` instance is returned
immediately. Users can then take the `id` of
`JobExecution` instance
(with `JobExecution.getJobId()`) and query the
`JobRepository` for the job's updated status
using the `JobExplorer`. For more
information, please refer to the Spring
Batch reference documentation on
<<job.adoc#queryingRepository,Querying the Repository>>.



[[spring-batch-integration-configuration]]

===== Spring Batch Integration Configuration

Consider a case where someone needs to create a file `inbound-channel-adapter` to listen
for CSV files in the provided directory, hand them off to a transformer
(`FileMessageToJobRequest`), launch the job through the _Job Launching Gateway_, and then
log the output of the `JobExecution` with the `logging-channel-adapter`.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example shows how that common case can be configured in XML:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<int:channel id="inboundFileChannel"/>
<int:channel id="outboundJobRequestChannel"/>
<int:channel id="jobLaunchReplyChannel"/>

<int-file:inbound-channel-adapter id="filePoller"

    directory="file:/tmp/myfiles/"
    filename-pattern="*.csv">
  <int:poller fixed-rate="1000"/>
</int-file:inbound-channel-adapter>

<int:transformer input-channel="inboundFileChannel"

</int:transformer>

<batch-int:job-launching-gateway request-channel="outboundJobRequestChannel"

[role="javaContent"]

[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
@Bean
public FileMessageToJobRequest fileMessageToJobRequest() {
    FileMessageToJobRequest fileMessageToJobRequest = new FileMessageToJobRequest();
    fileMessageToJobRequest.setFileParameterName("input.file.name");
    fileMessageToJobRequest.setJob(personJob());
    return fileMessageToJobRequest;
}

@Bean
public JobLaunchingGateway jobLaunchingGateway() {
    SimpleJobLauncher simpleJobLauncher = new SimpleJobLauncher();
    simpleJobLauncher.setJobRepository(jobRepository);
    simpleJobLauncher.setTaskExecutor(new SyncTaskExecutor());
    JobLaunchingGateway jobLaunchingGateway = new JobLaunchingGateway(simpleJobLauncher);

    return jobLaunchingGateway;
}

@Bean
public IntegrationFlow integrationFlow(JobLaunchingGateway jobLaunchingGateway) {
    return IntegrationFlows.from(Files.inboundAdapter(new File("/tmp/myfiles")).
                    filter(new SimplePatternFileListFilter("*.csv")),
            c -> c.poller(Pollers.fixedRate(1000).maxMessagesPerPoll(1))).
            transform(fileMessageToJobRequest()).
            handle(jobLaunchingGateway).
            log(LoggingHandler.Level.WARN, "headers.id + ': ' + payload").
            get();
}
----


[[example-itemreader-configuration]]
===== Example ItemReader Configuration

Now that we are polling for files and launching jobs, we need to configure our Spring
Batch `ItemReader` (for example) to use the files found at the location defined by the job
parameter called "input.file.name", as shown in the following bean configuration:

[role="xmlContent"]
The following XML example shows the necessary bean configuration:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<bean id="itemReader" class="org.springframework.batch.item.file.FlatFileItemReader"
    scope="step">
  <property name="resource" value="file://#{jobParameters['input.file.name']}"/>
    ...
</bean>
----

[role="javaContent"]
The following Java example shows the necessary bean configuration:

.Java Configuration
[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
@Bean
@StepScope
public ItemReader sampleReader(@Value("#{jobParameters[input.file.name]}") String resource) {
...
    FlatFileItemReader flatFileItemReader = new FlatFileItemReader();
    flatFileItemReader.setResource(new FileSystemResource(resource));
...
    return flatFileItemReader;
}
----

The main points of interest in the preceding example are injecting the value of
`#{jobParameters['input.file.name']}`
as the Resource property value and setting the `ItemReader` bean
to have __Step scope__. Setting the bean to have Step scope takes advantage of
the late binding support, which allows access to the
`jobParameters` variable.


[[availableAttributesOfTheJobLaunchingGateway]]
=== Available Attributes of the Job-Launching Gateway

The job-launching gateway has the following attributes that you can set to control a job:

* `id`: Identifies the underlying Spring bean definition, which is an instance of either:
** `EventDrivenConsumer`
** `PollingConsumer`
(The exact implementation depends on whether the component's input channel is a
`SubscribableChannel` or `PollableChannel`.)
* `auto-startup`: Boolean flag to indicate that the endpoint should start automatically on
startup. The default is __true__.
* `request-channel`: The input `MessageChannel` of this endpoint.
* `reply-channel`: `MessageChannel` to which the resulting `JobExecution` payload is sent.
* `reply-timeout`: Lets you specify how long (in milliseconds) this gateway waits for the reply message
to be sent successfully to the reply channel before throwing
an exception. This attribute only applies when the channel
might block (for example, when using a bounded queue channel
that is currently full). Also, keep in mind that, when sending to a
`DirectChannel`, the invocation occurs
in the sender's thread. Therefore, the failing of the send
operation may be caused by other components further downstream.
The `reply-timeout` attribute maps to the
`sendTimeout` property of the underlying
`MessagingTemplate` instance. If not specified, the attribute
defaults to<emphasis>-1</emphasis>,
meaning that, by default, the `Gateway` waits indefinitely.
* `job-launcher`: Optional. Accepts a
custom
`JobLauncher`
bean reference.
If not specified the adapter
re-uses the instance that is registered under the `id` of
`jobLauncher`. If no default instance
exists, an exception is thrown.
* `order`: Specifies the order of invocation when this endpoint is connected as a subscriber
to a `SubscribableChannel`.

=== Sub-Elements
When this `Gateway` is receiving messages from a
`PollableChannel`, you must either provide
a global default `Poller` or provide a `Poller` sub-element to the
`Job Launching Gateway`.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example shows how to provide a poller in XML:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<batch-int:job-launching-gateway request-channel="queueChannel"
    reply-channel="replyChannel" job-launcher="jobLauncher">
  <int:poller fixed-rate="1000">
</batch-int:job-launching-gateway>
----

[role="javaContent"]
The following example shows how to provide a poller in Java:

.Java Configuration
[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "queueChannel", poller = @Poller(fixedRate="1000"))
public JobLaunchingGateway sampleJobLaunchingGateway() {
    JobLaunchingGateway jobLaunchingGateway = new JobLaunchingGateway(jobLauncher());
    jobLaunchingGateway.setOutputChannel(replyChannel());
    return jobLaunchingGateway;
}
----

[[providing-feedback-with-informational-messages]]
==== Providing Feedback with Informational Messages

As Spring Batch jobs can run for long times, providing progress
information is often critical. For example, stake-holders may want
to be notified if some or all parts of a batch job have failed.
Spring Batch provides support for this information being gathered
through:

* Active polling
* Event-driven listeners

When starting a Spring Batch job asynchronously (for example, by using the `Job Launching
Gateway`), a `JobExecution` instance is returned. Thus, `JobExecution.getJobId()` can be
used to continuously poll for status updates by retrieving updated instances of the
`JobExecution` from the `JobRepository` by using the `JobExplorer`. However, this is
considered sub-optimal, and an event-driven approach should be preferred.

Therefore, Spring Batch provides listeners, including the three most commonly used
listeners:

* `StepListener`
* `ChunkListener`
* `JobExecutionListener`

In the example shown in the following image, a Spring Batch job has been configured with a
`StepExecutionListener`. Thus, Spring Integration receives and processes any step before
or after events. For example, the received `StepExecution` can be inspected by using a
`Router`. Based on the results of that inspection, various things can occur (such as
routing a message to a Mail Outbound Channel Adapter), so that an Email notification can
be sent out based on some condition.

.Handling Informational Messages
image::{batch-asciidoc}images/handling-informational-messages.png[Handling Informational Messages, scaledwidth="60%"]


The following two-part example shows how a listener is configured to send a
message to a `Gateway` for a `StepExecution` events and log its output to a
`logging-channel-adapter`.

First, create the notification integration beans.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example shows the how to create the notification integration beans in XML:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<int:channel id="stepExecutionsChannel"/>

<int:gateway id="notificationExecutionsListener"
    service-interface="org.springframework.batch.core.StepExecutionListener"
    default-request-channel="stepExecutionsChannel"/>

<int:logging-channel-adapter channel="stepExecutionsChannel"/>
----

[role="javaContent"]
The following example shows the how to create the notification integration beans in Java:

.Java Configuration
[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "stepExecutionsChannel")
public LoggingHandler loggingHandler() {
    LoggingHandler adapter = new LoggingHandler(LoggingHandler.Level.WARN);
    adapter.setLoggerName("TEST_LOGGER");
    adapter.setLogExpressionString("headers.id + ': ' + payload");
    return adapter;
}

@MessagingGateway(name = "notificationExecutionsListener", defaultRequestChannel = "stepExecutionsChannel")
public interface NotificationExecutionListener extends StepExecutionListener {}
----

[role="javaContent"]
NOTE: You need to add the `@IntegrationComponentScan` annotation to your configuration.

[[message-gateway-entry-list]]

Second, modify your job to add a step-level listener.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example shows the how to add a step-level listener in XML:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<job id="importPayments">
    <step id="step1">
        <tasklet ../>
            <chunk ../>
            <listeners>
                <listener ref="notificationExecutionsListener"/>
            </listeners>
        </tasklet>
        ...
    </step>
</job>
----

[role="javaContent"]
The following example shows the how to add a step-level listener in Java:

.Java Configuration
[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
public Job importPaymentsJob() {
    return jobBuilderFactory.get("importPayments")
        .start(stepBuilderFactory.get("step1")
                .chunk(200)
                .listener(notificationExecutionsListener())
                ...
}
----

[[asynchronous-processors]]

==== Asynchronous Processors


Asynchronous Processors help you to scale the processing of items. In the asynchronous
processor use case, an `AsyncItemProcessor` serves as a dispatcher, executing the logic of
the `ItemProcessor` for an item on a new thread. Once the item completes, the `Future` is
passed to the `AsynchItemWriter` to be written.

Therefore, you can increase performance by using asynchronous item processing, basically
letting you implement _fork-join_ scenarios. The `AsyncItemWriter` gathers the results and
writes back the chunk as soon as all the results become available.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example shows how to configuration the `AsyncItemProcessor` in XML:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<bean id="processor"
    class="org.springframework.batch.integration.async.AsyncItemProcessor">
  <property name="delegate">
    <bean class="your.ItemProcessor"/>
  </property>
  <property name="taskExecutor">
    <bean class="org.springframework.core.task.SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor"/>
  </property>
</bean>
----

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example shows how to configuration the `AsyncItemProcessor` in XML:

.Java Configuration
[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
@Bean
public AsyncItemProcessor processor(ItemProcessor itemProcessor, TaskExecutor taskExecutor) {
    AsyncItemProcessor asyncItemProcessor = new AsyncItemProcessor();
    asyncItemProcessor.setTaskExecutor(taskExecutor);
    asyncItemProcessor.setDelegate(itemProcessor);
    return asyncItemProcessor;
}
----

The `delegate` property refers to your `ItemProcessor` bean, and the `taskExecutor`
property refers to the `TaskExecutor` of your choice.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example shows how to configure the `AsyncItemWriter` in XML:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<bean id="itemWriter"
    class="org.springframework.batch.integration.async.AsyncItemWriter">
  <property name="delegate">
    <bean id="itemWriter" class="your.ItemWriter"/>
  </property>
</bean>
----

[role="javaContent"]
The following example shows how to configure the `AsyncItemWriter` in Java:

.Java Configuration
[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
@Bean
public AsyncItemWriter writer(ItemWriter itemWriter) {
    AsyncItemWriter asyncItemWriter = new AsyncItemWriter();
    asyncItemWriter.setDelegate(itemWriter);
    return asyncItemWriter;
}
----

Again, the `delegate` property is
actually a reference to your `ItemWriter` bean.


[[externalizing-batch-process-execution]]

==== Externalizing Batch Process Execution


The integration approaches discussed so far suggest use cases
where Spring Integration wraps Spring Batch like an outer-shell.
However, Spring Batch can also use Spring Integration internally.
Using this approach, Spring Batch users can delegate the
processing of items or even chunks to outside processes. This
allows you to offload complex processing. Spring Batch Integration
provides dedicated support for:



* Remote Chunking



* Remote Partitioning


[[remote-chunking]]

===== Remote Chunking

.Remote Chunking
image::{batch-asciidoc}images/remote-chunking-sbi.png[Remote Chunking, scaledwidth="60%"]

Taking things one step further, one can also externalize the
chunk processing by using the
`ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter`
(provided by Spring Batch Integration), which sends items out
and collects the result. Once sent, Spring Batch continues the
process of reading and grouping items, without waiting for the results.
Rather, it is the responsibility of the `ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter`
to gather the results and integrate them back into the Spring Batch process.


With Spring Integration, you have full
control over the concurrency of your processes (for instance, by
using a `QueueChannel` instead of a
`DirectChannel`). Furthermore, by relying on
Spring Integration's rich collection of Channel Adapters (such as
JMS and AMQP), you can distribute chunks of a Batch job to
external systems for processing.

[role="xmlContent"]
A job with a step to be remotely chunked might have a configuration similar to the
following in XML:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<job id="personJob">
  <step id="step1">
    <tasklet>
      <chunk reader="itemReader" writer="itemWriter" commit-interval="200"/>
    </tasklet>
    ...
  </step>
</job>
----

[role="javaContent"]
A job with a step to be remotely chunked might have a configuration similar to the
following in Java:

.Java Configuration
[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
public Job chunkJob() {
     return jobBuilderFactory.get("personJob")
             .start(stepBuilderFactory.get("step1")
                     .<Person, Person>chunk(200)
                     .reader(itemReader())
                     .writer(itemWriter())
                     .build())
             .build();
 }
----

The `ItemReader` reference points to the bean you want to use for reading data on the
master. The `ItemWriter` reference points to a special `ItemWriter` (called
`ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter`), as described above. The processor (if any) is left off
the master configuration, as it is configured on the slave. You should check any
additional component properties, such  as throttle limits and so on, when implementing
your use case.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following XML configuration  provides a basic master setup:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]

</int:channel>

<int-jms:message-driven-channel-adapter id="jmsReplies"
    destination-name="replies"
    channel="replies"/>
----

[role="javaContent"]
The following Java configuration  provides a basic master setup:

.Java Configuration
[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
@Bean
public org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
    ActiveMQConnectionFactory factory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory();
    factory.setBrokerURL("tcp://localhost:61616");
    return factory;
}

/*
 * Configure outbound flow (requests going to workers)
 */
@Bean
public DirectChannel requests() {
    return new DirectChannel();
}

@Bean
public IntegrationFlow outboundFlow(ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return IntegrationFlows
            .from(requests())
            .handle(Jms.outboundAdapter(connectionFactory).destination("requests"))
            .get();
}

/*
 * Configure inbound flow (replies coming from workers)
 */
@Bean
public QueueChannel replies() {
    return new QueueChannel();
}

@Bean
public IntegrationFlow inboundFlow(ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    return IntegrationFlows
            .from(Jms.messageDrivenChannelAdapter(connectionFactory).destination("replies"))
            .channel(replies())
            .get();
}

/*
 * Configure the ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter
 */
@Bean
public ItemWriter<Integer> itemWriter() {
    MessagingTemplate messagingTemplate = new MessagingTemplate();
    messagingTemplate.setDefaultChannel(requests());
    messagingTemplate.setReceiveTimeout(2000);
    ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter<Integer> chunkMessageChannelItemWriter
            = new ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter<>();
    chunkMessageChannelItemWriter.setMessagingOperations(messagingTemplate);
    chunkMessageChannelItemWriter.setReplyChannel(replies());
    return chunkMessageChannelItemWriter;
}
----

The preceding configuration provides us with a number of beans. We
configure our messaging middleware using ActiveMQ and the
inbound/outbound JMS adapters provided by Spring Integration. As
shown, our `itemWriter` bean, which is
referenced by our job step, uses the
`ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter` for writing chunks over the
configured middleware.

Now we can move on to the slave configuration.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example shows the slave configuration in XML:

.XML Configuration

Most of these configuration items should look familiar from the
manager configuration. Workers do not need access to
the Spring Batch `JobRepository` nor
to the actual job configuration file. The main bean of interest
is the `chunkProcessorChunkHandler`. The
`chunkProcessor` property of `ChunkProcessorChunkHandler` takes a
configured `SimpleChunkProcessor`, which is where you would provide a reference to your
`ItemWriter` (and, optionally, your
`ItemProcessor`) that will run on the worker
when it receives chunks from the manager.

For more information, see the section of the "Scalability" chapter on
link:$$https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/docs/current/reference/html/scalability.html#remoteChunking$$[Remote Chunking].

Starting from version 4.1, Spring Batch Integration introduces the `@EnableBatchIntegration`
annotation that can be used to simplify a remote chunking setup. This annotation provides
two beans that can be autowired in the application context:

* `RemoteChunkingManagerStepBuilderFactory`: used to configure the manager step
* `RemoteChunkingWorkerBuilder`: used to configure the remote worker integration flow

These APIs take care of configuring a number of components as described in the following diagram:

.Remote Chunking Configuration
image::{batch-asciidoc}images/remote-chunking-config.png[Remote Chunking Configuration, scaledwidth="80%"]

On the manager side, the `RemoteChunkingManagerStepBuilderFactory` lets you
configure a manager step by declaring:

* the item reader to read items and send them to workers
* the output channel ("Outgoing requests") to send requests to workers
* the input channel ("Incoming replies") to receive replies from workers

A `ChunkMessageChannelItemWriter` and the `MessagingTemplate` are not needed to be explicitly configured
(Those can still be explicitly configured if required).

On the worker side, the `RemoteChunkingWorkerBuilder` allows you to configure a worker to:

* listen to requests sent by the manager on the input channel ("Incoming requests")
* call the `handleChunk` method of `ChunkProcessorChunkHandler` for each request
with the configured `ItemProcessor` and `ItemWriter`
* send replies on the output channel ("Outgoing replies") to the manager

There is no need to explicitly configure the `SimpleChunkProcessor`
and the `ChunkProcessorChunkHandler` (Those can be explicitly configured if required).

The following example shows how to use these APIs:

[source, java]
----
@EnableBatchIntegration
@EnableBatchProcessing
public class RemoteChunkingJobConfiguration {

    @Configuration
    public static class ManagerConfiguration {

        @Autowired
        private RemoteChunkingManagerStepBuilderFactory managerStepBuilderFactory;

        @Bean
        public TaskletStep managerStep() {
            return this.managerStepBuilderFactory.get("managerStep")
                       .chunk(100)
                       .reader(itemReader())
                       .outputChannel(requests()) // requests sent to workers
                       .inputChannel(replies())   // replies received from workers
                       .build();
        }

        // Middleware beans setup omitted

    }

    @Configuration
    public static class WorkerConfiguration {

        @Autowired
        private RemoteChunkingWorkerBuilder workerBuilder;

        @Bean
        public IntegrationFlow workerFlow() {
            return this.workerBuilder
                       .itemProcessor(itemProcessor())
                       .itemWriter(itemWriter())
                       .inputChannel(requests()) // requests received from the manager
                       .outputChannel(replies()) // replies sent to the manager
                       .build();
        }

        // Middleware beans setup omitted

[[remote-partitioning]]

===== Remote Partitioning

.Remote Partitioning
image::{batch-asciidoc}images/remote-partitioning.png[Remote Partitioning, scaledwidth="60%"]


Remote Partitioning, on the other hand, is useful when it
is not the processing of items but rather the associated I/O that
causes the bottleneck. Using Remote Partitioning, work can
be farmed out to workers that execute complete Spring Batch
steps. Thus, each worker has its own `ItemReader`, `ItemProcessor`, and
`ItemWriter`. For this purpose, Spring Batch
Integration provides the `MessageChannelPartitionHandler`.



This implementation of the `PartitionHandler`
interface uses `MessageChannel` instances to
send instructions to remote workers and receive their responses.
This provides a nice abstraction from the transports (such as JMS
and AMQP) being used to communicate with the remote workers.



The section of the "Scalability" chapter that addresses
<<scalability.adoc#partitioning,remote partitioning>> provides an overview of the concepts and
components needed to configure remote partitioning and shows an
example of using the default
`TaskExecutorPartitionHandler` to partition
in separate local threads of execution. For remote partitioning
to multiple JVMs, two additional components are required:

* A remoting fabric or grid environment
* A `PartitionHandler` implementation that supports the desired
remoting fabric or grid environment



Similar to remote chunking, JMS can be used as the "`remoting fabric`". In that case, use
a `MessageChannelPartitionHandler` instance as the `PartitionHandler` implementation,
as described earlier.

You must also ensure that the partition `handler` attribute maps to the `partitionHandler`
bean.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example maps the partition `handler` attribute to the `partitionHandler` in
XML:

.XML Configuration
[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<job id="personJob">
  <step id="step1.manager">
    <partition partitioner="partitioner" handler="partitionHandler"/>
    ...
  </step>
</job>
----

[role="javaContent"]
The following example maps the partition `handler` attribute to the `partitionHandler` in
Java:

.Java Configuration
[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
	public Job personJob() {
		return jobBuilderFactory.get("personJob")
				.start(stepBuilderFactory.get("step1.manager")
						.partitioner("step1.worker", partitioner())
						.partitionHandler(partitionHandler())
						.build())
				.build();
	}

You can find a complete example of a remote partitioning job
link:$$https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/tree/master/spring-batch-samples#remote-partitioning-sample$$[here].

The `@EnableBatchIntegration` annotation that can be used to simplify a remote
 partitioning setup. This annotation provides two beans useful for remote partitioning:

* `RemotePartitioningManagerStepBuilderFactory`: used to configure the manager step
* `RemotePartitioningWorkerStepBuilderFactory`: used to configure the worker step

These APIs take care of configuring a number of components as described in the following diagram:

.Remote Partitioning Configuration (with job repository polling)
image::{batch-asciidoc}images/remote-partitioning-polling-config.png[Remote Partitioning Configuration (with job repository polling), scaledwidth="80%"]

.Remote Partitioning Configuration (with replies aggregation)
image::{batch-asciidoc}images/remote-partitioning-aggregation-config.png[Remote Partitioning Configuration (with replies aggregation), scaledwidth="80%"]

On the manager side, the `RemotePartitioningManagerStepBuilderFactory` allows you to
configure a manager step by declaring:

* the `Partitioner` used to partition data
* the output channel ("Outgoing requests") to send requests to workers
* the input channel ("Incoming replies") to receive replies from workers (when configuring replies aggregation)
* the poll interval and timeout parameters (when configuring job repository polling)

The `MessageChannelPartitionHandler` and the `MessagingTemplate` are not needed to be explicitly configured
(Those can still be explicitly configured if required).

On the worker side, the `RemotePartitioningWorkerStepBuilderFactory` allows you to configure a worker to:

* listen to requests sent by the manager on the input channel ("Incoming requests")
* call the `handle` method of `StepExecutionRequestHandler` for each request
* send replies on the output channel ("Outgoing replies") to the manager

There is no need to explicitly configure the `StepExecutionRequestHandler` (which can be explicitly configured if required).

The following example shows how to use these APIs:

[source, java]

@EnableBatchIntegration

    @Configuration
    public static class ManagerConfiguration {

                    .outputChannel(outgoingRequestsToWorkers())
                    .inputChannel(incomingRepliesFromWorkers())
                    .build();
        }
