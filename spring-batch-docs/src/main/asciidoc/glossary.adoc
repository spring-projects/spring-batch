Batch::
  An accumulation of business transactions over time.

Batch Application Style::
  Term used to designate batch as an application style in its own right, similar to
  online, Web, or SOA. It has standard elements of input, validation, transformation of
  information to business model, business processing, and output. In addition, it
  requires monitoring at a macro level.

Batch Processing::
  The handling of a batch of many business transactions that have accumulated over a
  period of time (such as an hour, a day, a week, a month, or a year). It is the
  application of a process or set of processes to many data entities or objects in a
  repetitive and predictable fashion with either no manual element or a separate manual
  element for error processing.

Batch Window::
  The time frame within which a batch job must complete. This can be constrained by other
  systems coming online, other dependent jobs needing to execute, or other factors
  specific to the batch environment.

Step::
  The main batch task or unit of work. It initializes the business logic and controls the
  transaction environment, based on the commit interval setting and other factors.

Tasklet::
  A component created by an application developer to process the business logic for a
  Step.

Batch Job Type::
  Job types describe application of jobs for particular types of processing. Common areas
  are interface processing (typically flat files), forms processing (either for online
  PDF generation or print formats), and report processing.

Driving Query::
  A driving query identifies the set of work for a job to do. The job then breaks that
  work into individual units of work. For instance, a driving query might be to identify
  all financial transactions that have a status of "`pending transmission`" and send them
  to a partner system. The driving query returns a set of record IDs to process. Each
  record ID then becomes a unit of work. A driving query may involve a join (if the
  criteria for selection falls across two or more tables) or it may work with a single
  table.

Item::
  An item represents the smallest amount of complete data for processing. In the simplest
  terms, this might be a line in a file, a row in a database table, or a particular
  element in an XML file.

Logicial Unit of Work (LUW)::
  A batch job iterates through a driving query (or other input source, such as a file) to
  perform the set of work that the job must accomplish. Each iteration of work performed
  is a unit of work.

Commit Interval::
  A set of LUWs processed within a single transaction.

Partitioning::
  Splitting a job into multiple threads where each thread is responsible for a subset of
  the overall data to be processed. The threads of execution may be within the same JVM
  or they may span JVMs in a clustered environment that supports workload balancing.

Staging Table::
  A table that holds temporary data while it is being processed.

Restartable::
  A job that can be executed again and assumes the same identity as when run initially.
  In other words, it has the same job instance ID.

Rerunnable::
  A job that is restartable and manages its own state in terms of the previous run's
  record processing. An example of a re-runnable step is one based on a driving query. If
  the driving query can be formed so that it limits the processed rows when the job is
  restarted, then it is re-runnable. This is managed by the application logic. Often, a
  condition is added to the `where` statement to limit the rows returned by the driving
  query with logic resembling `and processedFlag!= true`.

Repeat::
  One of the most basic units of batch processing, it defines by repeatedly calling a
  portion of code until it is finished and while there is no error. Typically, a batch
  process would be repeatable as long as there is input.

Retry::
  Simplifies the execution of operations with retry semantics most frequently associated
  with handling transactional output exceptions. Retry is slightly different from repeat.
  Rather than continually calling a block of code, retry is stateful and continually
  calls the same block of code with the same input, until it either succeeds or some type
  of retry limit has been exceeded. It is generally useful only when a subsequent
  invocation of the operation might succeed because something in the environment has
  improved.

Recover::
  Recover operations handle an exception in such a way that a repeat process is able to
  continue.

Skip::
  Skip is a recovery strategy often used on file input sources as the strategy for
  ignoring bad input records that failed validation.
