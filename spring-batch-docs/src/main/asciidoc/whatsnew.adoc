== What's New in Spring Batch 5.0

Spring Batch 5.0 release has the following major themes:

* Java 17 Requirement
* Dependencies Re-baseline
* Batch infrastructure configuration updates
* New features
* Pruning

For more details about the changes,
please refer to the link:$$https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/wiki/Spring-Batch-5.0-Migration-Guide$$[migration guide].

=== Java 17 Requirement

Spring Batch follows Spring Framework's baselines for both Java version and third party dependencies.
With Spring Batch 5, the Spring Framework version is being upgraded to Spring Framework 6 which requires Java 17.
As a result, the Java version requirement for Spring Batch is also increasing to Java 17.

=== Dependencies Re-baseline

In order to continue the integration with supported versions of the third party libraries that Spring Batch uses,
Spring Batch 5 is updating the dependencies across the board to the following versions:

* Spring Framework 6
* Spring Integration 6
* Spring Data 3
* Spring AMQP 3
* Spring for Apache Kafka 3
* Micrometer 2

This release also marks the migration to Jakarta EE 9 APIs.

=== Batch infrastructure configuration updates

==== DataSource requirement updates

Historically, Spring Batch provided a Map-based job repository and job explorer implementations to work with
an in-memory job repository. These implementations were deprecated in version 4 and completely removed in version 5.
The recommended replacement is to use the Jdbc-based implementations with an embedded database like H2, HSQL, etc.

In this release, the `@EnableBatchProcessing` annotation will configure a Jdbc-based `JobRepository` which requires a
`DataSource` bean in the application context. The `DataSource` bean could refer to an embedded database to work with
an in-memory job repository.

==== Transaction manager bean exposure

Up until version 4.3, the `@EnableBatchProcessing` annotation exposed a tranasaction manager bean in the application
context. While this was convenient in many cases, the unconditional exposure of a tranasaction manager could
interfere with a user-defined transaction manager. In this release, `@EnableBatchProcessing` does not expose a
transaction manager bean in the application context anymore.

=== New features

==== Batch tracing with Micrometer

With the upgrade to Micrometer 2, you can now get batch tracing in addition to batch metrics.
Spring Batch will create a span for each job and a span for each step within a job. This tracing
meta-data can be collected and viewed on a dahsboard like link:$$https://zipkin.io$$[Zipkin] for example.

==== Support for SAP HANA a job repository in Spring Batch

This release introduces the support of SAP HANA as an additional supported database for the job repository.

==== SQLFire support removal

SqlFire has been announced to be EOL as of November 1st, 2014. The support of SQLFire as a job repository
was deprecated in version 4.3 and removed in version 5.0.

==== JSR-352 implementation removal

Due to a lack of adoption, the implementation of the JSR-352 has been discontinued in this release.
