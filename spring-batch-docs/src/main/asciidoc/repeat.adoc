[[repeatTemplate]]

=== RepeatTemplate

Batch processing is about repetitive actions, either as a simple optimization or as part
of a job. To strategize and generalize the repetition and to provide what amounts to an
iterator framework, Spring Batch has the `RepeatOperations` interface. The
`RepeatOperations` interface has the following definition:

[source, java]
----
public interface RepeatOperations {

    RepeatStatus iterate(RepeatCallback callback) throws RepeatException;

}
----

The callback is an interface, shown in the following definition, that lets you insert
some business logic to be repeated:

[source, java]
----
public interface RepeatCallback {

    RepeatStatus doInIteration(RepeatContext context) throws Exception;

}
----

The callback is executed repeatedly until the implementation determines that the
iteration should end. The return value in these interfaces is an enumeration value that can
be either `RepeatStatus.CONTINUABLE` or `RepeatStatus.FINISHED`. A `RepeatStatus`
enumeration conveys information to the caller of the repeat operations about whether
any work remains. Generally speaking, implementations of `RepeatOperations`
should inspect `RepeatStatus` and use it as part of the decision to end the
iteration. Any callback that wishes to signal to the caller that there is no work remains
can return `RepeatStatus.FINISHED`.

The simplest general purpose implementation of `RepeatOperations` is `RepeatTemplate`:

[source, java]
----
RepeatTemplate template = new RepeatTemplate();

template.setCompletionPolicy(new SimpleCompletionPolicy(2));

template.iterate(new RepeatCallback() {

    public RepeatStatus doInIteration(RepeatContext context) {
        // Do stuff in batch...
        return RepeatStatus.CONTINUABLE;
    }

});
----

In the preceding example, we return `RepeatStatus.CONTINUABLE`, to show that there is
more work to do. The callback can also return `RepeatStatus.FINISHED`, to signal to the
caller that there is no work remains. Some iterations can be terminated by
considerations intrinsic to the work being done in the callback. Others are effectively
infinite loops (as far as the callback is concerned), and the completion decision is
delegated to an external policy, as in the case shown in the preceding example.

[[repeatContext]]

==== RepeatContext

The method parameter for the `RepeatCallback` is a `RepeatContext`. Many callbacks ignore
the context. However, if necessary, you can use it as an attribute bag to store transient
data for the duration of the iteration. After the `iterate` method returns, the context
no longer exists.

If there is a nested iteration in progress, a `RepeatContext` has a parent context. The
parent context is occasionally useful for storing data that need to be shared between
calls to `iterate`. This is the case, for instance, if you want to count the number of
occurrences of an event in the iteration and remember it across subsequent calls.

[[repeatStatus]]
==== RepeatStatus

`RepeatStatus` is an enumeration used by Spring Batch to indicate whether processing has
finished. It has two possible `RepeatStatus` values:

.RepeatStatus Properties

|===============
|__Value__|__Description__
|`CONTINUABLE`|There is more work to do.
|`FINISHED`|No more repetitions should take place.

|===============

You can combine `RepeatStatus` values with a logical AND operation by using the
`and()` method in `RepeatStatus`. The effect of this is to do a logical AND on the
continuable flag. In other words, if either status is `FINISHED`, the result is
`FINISHED`.

[[completionPolicies]]
=== Completion Policies

Inside a `RepeatTemplate`, the termination of the loop in the `iterate` method is
determined by a `CompletionPolicy`, which is also a factory for the `RepeatContext`. The
`RepeatTemplate` has the responsibility to use the current policy to create a
`RepeatContext` and pass that in to the `RepeatCallback` at every stage in the iteration.
After a callback completes its `doInIteration`, the `RepeatTemplate` has to make a call
to the `CompletionPolicy` to ask it to update its state (which will be stored in the
`RepeatContext`). Then it asks the policy if the iteration is complete.

Spring Batch provides some simple general purpose implementations of `CompletionPolicy`.
`SimpleCompletionPolicy` allows execution up to a fixed number of times (with
`RepeatStatus.FINISHED` forcing early completion at any time).

Users might need to implement their own completion policies for more complicated
decisions. For example, a batch processing window that prevents batch jobs from executing
once the online systems are in use would require a custom policy.

[[repeatExceptionHandling]]
=== Exception Handling

If there is an exception thrown inside a `RepeatCallback`, the `RepeatTemplate` consults
an `ExceptionHandler`, which can decide whether or not to re-throw the exception.

The following listing shows the `ExceptionHandler` interface definition:

[source, java]
----
public interface ExceptionHandler {

    void handleException(RepeatContext context, Throwable throwable)
        throws Throwable;

}
----

A common use case is to count the number of exceptions of a given type and fail when a
limit is reached. For this purpose, Spring Batch provides the
`SimpleLimitExceptionHandler` and a slightly more flexible
`RethrowOnThresholdExceptionHandler`. The `SimpleLimitExceptionHandler` has a limit
property and an exception type that should be compared with the current exception. All
subclasses of the provided type are also counted. Exceptions of the given type are
ignored until the limit is reached, and then they are rethrown. Exceptions of other types
are always rethrown.

An important optional property of the `SimpleLimitExceptionHandler` is the boolean flag
called `useParent`. It is `false` by default, so the limit is only accounted for in the
current `RepeatContext`. When set to `true`, the limit is kept across sibling contexts in
a nested iteration (such as a set of chunks inside a step).

[[repeatListeners]]
=== Listeners

Often, it is useful to be able to receive additional callbacks for cross-cutting concerns
across a number of different iterations. For this purpose, Spring Batch provides the
`RepeatListener` interface. The `RepeatTemplate` lets users register `RepeatListener`
implementations, and they are given callbacks with the `RepeatContext` and `RepeatStatus`
where available during the iteration.

The `RepeatListener` interface has the following definition:

[source, java]
----
public interface RepeatListener {
    void before(RepeatContext context);
    void after(RepeatContext context, RepeatStatus result);
    void open(RepeatContext context);
    void onError(RepeatContext context, Throwable e);
    void close(RepeatContext context);
}
----

The `open` and `close` callbacks come before and after the entire iteration. `before`,
`after`, and `onError` apply to the individual `RepeatCallback` calls.

Note that, when there is more than one listener, they are in a list, so there is an
order. In this case, `open` and `before` are called in the same order while `after`,
`onError`, and `close` are called in reverse order.

[[repeatParallelProcessing]]
=== Parallel Processing

Implementations of `RepeatOperations` are not restricted to executing the callback
sequentially. It is quite important that some implementations are able to execute their
callbacks in parallel. To this end, Spring Batch provides the
`TaskExecutorRepeatTemplate`, which uses the Spring `TaskExecutor` strategy to run the
`RepeatCallback`. The default is to use a `SynchronousTaskExecutor`, which has the effect
of executing the whole iteration in the same thread (the same as a normal
`RepeatTemplate`).

[[declarativeIteration]]
=== Declarative Iteration

Sometimes, there is some business processing that you know you want to repeat every time
it happens. The classic example of this is the optimization of a message pipeline.
If a batch of messages arrives frequently, it is more efficient to process them than to
bear the cost of a separate transaction for every message. Spring Batch provides an AOP
interceptor that wraps a method call in a `RepeatOperations` object for this
purpose. The `RepeatOperationsInterceptor` executes the intercepted method and repeats
according to the `CompletionPolicy` in the provided `RepeatTemplate`.

[role="xmlContent"]
The following example shows declarative iteration that uses the Spring AOP namespace to
repeat a service call to a method called `processMessage` (for more detail on how to
configure AOP interceptors, see the
<<https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#aop,Spring User Guide>>):

[source, xml, role="xmlContent"]
----
<aop:config>
    <aop:pointcut id="transactional"
        expression="execution(* com..*Service.processMessage(..))" />
    <aop:advisor pointcut-ref="transactional"
        advice-ref="retryAdvice" order="-1"/>
</aop:config>

<bean id="retryAdvice" class="org.spr...RepeatOperationsInterceptor"/>
----

[role="javaContent"]
The following example uses Java configuration to
repeat a service call to a method called `processMessage` (for more detail on how to
configure AOP interceptors, see the
<<https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#aop,Spring User Guide>>):

[source, java, role="javaContent"]
----
@Bean
public MyService myService() {
	ProxyFactory factory = new ProxyFactory(RepeatOperations.class.getClassLoader());
	factory.setInterfaces(MyService.class);
	factory.setTarget(new MyService());

	MyService service = (MyService) factory.getProxy();
	JdkRegexpMethodPointcut pointcut = new JdkRegexpMethodPointcut();
	pointcut.setPatterns(".*processMessage.*");

	RepeatOperationsInterceptor interceptor = new RepeatOperationsInterceptor();

	((Advised) service).addAdvisor(new DefaultPointcutAdvisor(pointcut, interceptor));

	return service;
}
----

The preceding example uses a default `RepeatTemplate` inside the interceptor. To change
the policies, listeners, and other details, you can inject an instance of
`RepeatTemplate` into the interceptor.

If the intercepted method returns `void`, the interceptor always returns
`RepeatStatus.CONTINUABLE` (so there is a danger of an infinite loop if the
`CompletionPolicy` does not have a finite end point). Otherwise, it returns
`RepeatStatus.CONTINUABLE` until the return value from the intercepted method is `null`.
At that point, it returns `RepeatStatus.FINISHED`. Consequently, the business logic
inside the target method can signal that there is no more work to do by returning `null`
or by throwing an exception that is rethrown by the `ExceptionHandler` in the provided
`RepeatTemplate`.
