== Retry

To make processing more robust and less prone to failure, it sometimes helps to
automatically retry a failed operation in case it might succeed on a subsequent attempt.
Errors that are susceptible to intermittent failure are often transient in nature.
Examples include remote calls to a web service that fails because of a network glitch or a
`DeadlockLoserDataAccessException` in a database update.

[NOTE]
====
As of version 2.2.0, the retry functionality was pulled out of Spring Batch.
It is now part of a new library, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-retry[Spring Retry].
Spring Batch still relies on Spring Retry to automate retry operations within the framework.
See the reference documentation of Spring Retry for details about
key APIs and how to use them.
