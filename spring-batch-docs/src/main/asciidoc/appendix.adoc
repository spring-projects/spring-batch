[options="header"]
|===============
|Item Reader|Description
|`AbstractItemCountingItemStreamItemReader`|Abstract base class that provides basic
            restart capabilities by counting the number of items returned from
            an `ItemReader`.
|`AggregateItemReader`|An `ItemReader` that delivers a list as its
            item, storing up objects from the injected `ItemReader` until they
            are ready to be packed out as a collection. This class must be used
            as a wrapper for a custom `ItemReader` that can identify the record
            boundaries. The custom reader should mark the beginning and end of
            records by returning an `AggregateItem` which responds `true` to its
            query methods (`isHeader()` and `isFooter()`). Note that this reader
            is not part of the library of readers provided by Spring Batch
            but given as a sample in `spring-batch-samples`.
|`AmqpItemReader`|Given a Spring `AmqpTemplate`, it provides
            synchronous receive methods. The `receiveAndConvert()` method
            lets you receive POJO objects.
|`KafkaItemReader`|An `ItemReader` that reads messages from an Apache Kafka topic.
It can be configured to read messages from multiple partitions of the same topic.
This reader stores message offsets in the execution context to support restart capabilities.
|`FlatFileItemReader`|Reads from a flat file. Includes `ItemStream`
            and `Skippable` functionality. See link:readersAndWriters.html#flatFileItemReader["`FlatFileItemReader`"].
|`HibernateCursorItemReader`|Reads from a cursor based on an HQL query. See
            link:readersAndWriters.html#cursorBasedItemReaders[`Cursor-based ItemReaders`].
|`HibernatePagingItemReader`|Reads from a paginated HQL query.
|`ItemReaderAdapter`|Adapts any class to the
            `ItemReader` interface.
|`JdbcCursorItemReader`|Reads from a database cursor over JDBC. See
            link:readersAndWriters.html#cursorBasedItemReaders["`Cursor-based ItemReaders`"].
|`JdbcPagingItemReader`|Given an SQL statement, pages through the rows,
            such that large datasets can be read without running out of
            memory.
|`JmsItemReader`|Given a Spring `JmsOperations` object and a JMS
            destination or destination name to which to send errors, provides items
            received through the injected `JmsOperations#receive()`
            method.
|`JpaPagingItemReader`|Given a JPQL statement, pages through the
            rows, such that large datasets can be read without running out of
            memory.
|`ListItemReader`|Provides the items from a list, one at a
            time.
|`MongoItemReader`|Given a `MongoOperations` object and a JSON-based MongoDB
            query, provides items received from the `MongoOperations#find()` method.
|`Neo4jItemReader`|Given a `Neo4jOperations` object and the components of a
            Cyhper query, items are returned as the result of the Neo4jOperations.query
            method.
|`RepositoryItemReader`|Given a Spring Data `PagingAndSortingRepository` object,
            a `Sort`, and the name of method to execute, returns items provided by the
            Spring Data repository implementation.
|`StoredProcedureItemReader`|Reads from a database cursor resulting from the
            execution of a database stored procedure. See link:readersAndWriters.html#StoredProcedureItemReader[`StoredProcedureItemReader`]
|`StaxEventItemReader`|Reads over StAX. see link:readersAndWriters.html#StaxEventItemReader[`StaxEventItemReader`].
|`JsonItemReader`|Reads items from a Json document. see link:readersAndWriters.html#JsonItemReader[`JsonItemReader`].

=== Item Writers

.Available Item Writers

|===============
|Item Writer|Description
|`AbstractItemStreamItemWriter`|Abstract base class that combines the
            `ItemStream` and
            `ItemWriter` interfaces.
|`AmqpItemWriter`|Given a Spring `AmqpTemplate`, provides
            for a synchronous `send` method. The `convertAndSend(Object)`
             method lets you send POJO objects.
|`CompositeItemWriter`|Passes an item to the `write` method of each item
            in an injected `List` of `ItemWriter` objects.
|`FlatFileItemWriter`|Writes to a flat file. Includes `ItemStream` and
            Skippable functionality. See link:readersAndWriters.html#flatFileItemWriter["`FlatFileItemWriter`"].
|`GemfireItemWriter`|Using a `GemfireOperations` object, items are either written
            or removed from the Gemfire instance based on the configuration of the delete
            flag.
|`HibernateItemWriter`|This item writer is Hibernate-session aware
            and handles some transaction-related work that a non-"`hibernate-aware`"
            item writer would not need to know about and then delegates
            to another item writer to do the actual writing.
|`ItemWriterAdapter`|Adapts any class to the
            `ItemWriter` interface.
|`JdbcBatchItemWriter`|Uses batching features from a
            `PreparedStatement`, if available, and can
            take rudimentary steps to locate a failure during a
            `flush`.
|`JmsItemWriter`|Using a `JmsOperations` object, items are written
            to the default queue through the `JmsOperations#convertAndSend()` method.
|`JpaItemWriter`|This item writer is JPA `EntityManager`-aware
            and handles some transaction-related work that a non-"`JPA-aware`"
            `ItemWriter` would not need to know about and
            then delegates to another writer to do the actual writing.
|`KafkaItemWriter`|Using a `KafkaTemplate` object, items are written to the default topic through the
            `KafkaTemplate#sendDefault(Object, Object)` method by using a `Converter` to map the key from the item.
            A delete flag can also be configured to send delete events to the topic.
|`MimeMessageItemWriter`|Using Spring's `JavaMailSender`, items of type `MimeMessage`
            are sent as mail messages.
|`MongoItemWriter`|Given a `MongoOperations` object, items are written
            through the `MongoOperations.save(Object)` method.  The actual write is delayed
            until the last possible moment before the transaction commits.
|`Neo4jItemWriter`|Given a `Neo4jOperations` object, items are persisted through the
            `save(Object)` method or deleted through the `delete(Object)`, as dictated by the
            `ItemWriter's` configuration
|`PropertyExtractingDelegatingItemWriter`|Extends `AbstractMethodInvokingDelegator`
            creating arguments on the fly. Arguments are created by retrieving
            the values from the fields in the item to be processed (through a
            `SpringBeanWrapper`), based on an injected array of field
            names.
|`RepositoryItemWriter`|Given a Spring Data `CrudRepository` implementation,
            items are saved through the method specified in the configuration.
|`StaxEventItemWriter`|Uses a `Marshaller` implementation to
            convert each item to XML and then writes it to an XML file by using
            StAX.
|`JsonFileItemWriter`|Uses a `JsonObjectMarshaller` implementation to
            convert each item to Json and then writes it to a Json file.
