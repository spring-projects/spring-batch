# Spring Batch [![build status](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yml)

Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive batch framework designed to enable the development of robust batch applications vital for the daily operations of enterprise systems.  Spring Batch builds upon the productivity, POJO-based development approach, and general ease of use capabilities people have come to know from the [Spring Framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework), while making it easy for developers to access and leverage more advanced enterprise services when necessary.

If you are looking for a runtime orchestration tool for your Batch applications, or need a management console to view current and historic executions, take a look at [Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/).  It is an orchestration tool for deploying and executing data integration based microservices including Spring Batch applications.

# Getting Started

## Guide

This is the quickest way to get started with a new Spring Batch project based on Spring Boot. You find the Getting Started Guide here: [Creating a Batch Service](https://spring.io/guides/gs/batch-processing/).

## Samples

You can find several samples to try out here: [Spring Batch Samples](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/tree/main/spring-batch-samples).

# Getting Help

If you have a question or a support request, please open a new discussion on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/discussions)
or ask a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-batch).

Please do **not** create issues on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/issues) for questions or support requests.
We would like to keep the issue tracker **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests.

# Reporting issues

Spring Batch uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/issues) to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you open an issue, please search the issue tracker to see if someone has already reported the problem. If the issue doesn't already exist, create a new issue.
* Please provide as much information as possible in the issue report by following the [Issue Reporting Template](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
* If you need to paste code or include a stack trace, please use Markdown escapes (```) before and after your text.

For non trivial bugs, please create a test case or a project that replicates the problem and attach it to the issue, as detailed in the [Issue Reporting Guidelines](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/blob/main/ISSUE_REPORTING.md).

# Building from Source

## Using the Command Line

Clone the git repository using the URL on the Github home page:

    $ git clone git@github.com:spring-projects/spring-batch.git
    $ cd spring-batch

Maven is the build tool used for Spring Batch. You can build the project with the following command:

    $ ./mvnw package

If you want to perform a full build with all integration tests, then run:

    $ ./mvnw verify

Please note that some integration tests are based on Docker, so please make sure to have Docker up and running before running a full build.

To generate the reference documentation, run the following commands:

```
$ cd spring-batch-docs
$ ../mvnw antora:antora
```

The reference documentation can be found in `spring-batch-docs/target/anotra/site`.

## Using Docker

If you want to build the project in a Docker container, you can proceed as follows:

```
$> docker run -it --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/spring-batch maven:3-openjdk-17 bash
#> cd spring-batch
#> ./mvnw package
```

This will mount the source code that you cloned previously on the host inside the container.
If you want to work on a copy of the source code inside the container (no side effects on the host),
you can proceed as follows:

```
$> docker run -it maven:3-openjdk-17 bash
#> git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch.git
#> cd spring-batch
#> ./mvnw package
```
