/**
 * Provides {@link RepeatOperations} support including interceptors that can be used to
 * modify or monitor the behaviour at run time.<br>
 *
 * This implementation is sufficient to be used to configure transactional behaviour for
 * each item by making the {@link RepeatCallback} transactional, or for the whole batch by
 * making the execute method transactional (but only then if the task executor is
 * synchronous).<br>
 *
 * This class is thread-safe if its collaborators are thread-safe (interceptors,
 * terminationPolicy, callback). Normally this will be the case, but clients need to be
 * aware that if the task executor is asynchronous, then the other collaborators should be
 * also. In particular the {@link RepeatCallback} that is wrapped in the execute method
 * must be thread-safe - often it is based on some form of data source, which itself
 * should be both thread-safe and transactional (multiple threads could be accessing it at
 * any given time, and each thread would have its own transaction).<br>
