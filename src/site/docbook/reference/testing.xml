  <title>Unit Testing</title>

  <para>Just as with other application styles, it is extremely important to
  unit test any code written as part of a batch job as well. The Spring core
  documentation covers how to unit and integration test with Spring in great
  detail, so it won't be repeated here. It is important, however, to think
  about how to 'end to end' test a batch job, which is what this chapter will
  focus on. The spring-batch-test project includes classes that will help
  facilitate this end-to-end test approach.</para>

  <section id="creatingUnitTestClass">
    <title>Creating a Unit Test Class</title>

    <para>In order for the unit test to run a batch job, the framework must
    load the job's ApplicationContext. Two annotations are used to trigger
    this:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><classname>@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)</classname>:
        Indicates that the class should use Spring's JUnit facilities</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><classname>@ContextConfiguration(locations = {...})</classname>:
        Indicates which XML files contain the ApplicationContext.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <programlisting>@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(locations = { "/simple-job-launcher-context.xml", 
                                    "/jobs/skipSampleJob.xml" })
public class SkipSampleFunctionalTests extends AbstractJobTests { ... }</programlisting>
  </section>

  <section id="endToEndTesting">
    <title>End-To-End Testing of Batch Jobs</title>

    <para>'End To End' testing can be defined as testing the complete run of a
    batch job from beginning to end. This allows for a test that sets up a
    test condition, executes the job, and verifies the end result.</para>

    <para>In the example below, the batch job reads from the database and
    writes to a flat file. The test method begins by setting up the database
    with test data. It clears the CUSTOMER table and then inserts 10 new
    records. The test then launches the <classname>Job </classname>using the
    <methodname>launchJob()</methodname> method. The
    <methodname>launchJob</methodname>() method is provided by the
    <classname>AbstractJobTests</classname> parent class. Also provided by the
    super class is <classname>launchJob(JobParameters)</classname>, which
    allows the test to give particular parameters. The
    <methodname>launchJob()</methodname> method returns the
    <classname>JobExecution</classname> object which is useful for asserting
    particular information about the <classname>Job</classname> run. In the
    case below, the test verifies that the <classname>Job</classname> ended
    with status "COMPLETED".</para>

    <programlisting>@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
@ContextConfiguration(locations = { "/simple-job-launcher-context.xml", 
                                    "/jobs/skipSampleJob.xml" })
public class SkipSampleFunctionalTests {

    @Autowired
    private JobLauncherTestUtils jobLauncherTestUtils;

    private SimpleJdbcTemplate simpleJdbcTemplate;

    @Autowired
    public void setDataSource(DataSource dataSource) {
        this.simpleJdbcTemplate = new SimpleJdbcTemplate(dataSource);
    }

    @Test
    public void testJob() throws Exception {
        simpleJdbcTemplate.update("delete from CUSTOMER");
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {
            simpleJdbcTemplate.update("insert into CUSTOMER values (?, 0, ?, 100000)", 
                                      i, "customer" + i);
        }

        JobExecution jobExecution = jobLauncherTestUtils.launchJob().getStatus();


        Assert.assertEquals("COMPLETED", jobExecution.getExitStatus());
    }
}</programlisting>
  </section>

  <section id="testingIndividualSteps">
    <title>Testing Individual Steps</title>

    <para>For complex batch jobs, test cases in the end-to-end testing
    approach may become unmanageable. It these cases, it may be more useful to
    have test cases to test individual steps on their own. The
    <classname>AbstractJobTests</classname> class contains a method
    <methodname>launchStep</methodname> that takes a step name and runs just
    that particular <classname>Step</classname>. This approach allows for more
    targeted tests by allowing the test to set up data for just that step and
    to validate its results directly.</para>

    <programlisting>JobExecution jobExecution = jobLauncherTestUtils.launchStep("loadFileStep");</programlisting>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Testing Step-Scoped Components</title>

    <para>Often the components that are configured for your steps at runtime
    use step scope and late binding to inject context from the step or job
    execution. These are tricky to test as standalone components unless you
    have a way to set the context as if they were in a step execution. That is
    the goal of two components in Spring Batch: the
    <classname>StepScopeTestExecutionListener</classname> and the
    <classname>StepScopeTestUtils</classname>.</para>

    <para>The listener is declared at the class level, and its job is to
    create a step execution context for each test method. For example:</para>

    <programlisting>@ContextConfiguration
@TestExecutionListeners( { DependencyInjectionTestExecutionListener.class, 
    StepScopeTestExecutionListener.class })
@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
public class StepScopeTestExecutionListenerIntegrationTests {

    // This component is defined step-scoped, so it cannot be injected unless
    // a step is active...
    @Autowired
    private ItemReader&lt;String&gt; reader;

    public StepExecution getStepExection() {
        StepExecution execution = MetaDataInstanceFactory.createStepExecution();
        execution.getExecutionContext().putString("input.data", "foo,bar,spam");
        return execution;
    }

    @Test
    public void testReader() {
        // The reader is initialized and bound to the input data
        assertNotNull(reader.read());
    }
    
}</programlisting>

    <para>There are two <classname>TestExecutionListeners</classname>, one
    from the regular Spring Test framework and handles dependency injection
    from the configured application context, injecting the reader, and the
    other is the Spring Batch
    <classname>StepScopeTestExecutionListener</classname>. It works by looking
    for a factory method in the test case for a
    <classname>StepExecution</classname>, and using that as the context for
    the test method, as if that execution was active in a Step at runtime. The
    factory method is detected by its signature (it just has to return a
    <classname>StepExecution</classname>). If a factory method is not provided
    then a default <classname>StepExecution</classname> is created.</para>

    <para>The listener approach is convenient if you want the duration of the
    step scope to be the execution of the test method. For a more flexible,
    but more invasive approach you can use the
    <classname>StepScopeTestUtils</classname>. For example, to count the
    number of items available in the reader above:</para>

    <programlisting>int count = StepScopeTestUtils.doInStepScope(stepExecution, 
    new Callable&lt;Integer&gt;() {

      public Integer call() throws Exception {

        int count = 0;

        while (reader.read() != null) {
           count++;
        }

        return count;

    }
});</programlisting>
  </section>

  <section id="validatingOutputFiles">
    <title>Validating Output Files</title>

    <para>When a batch job writes to the database, it is easy to query the
    database to verify that the output is as expected. However, if the batch
    job writes to a file, it is equally important that the output be verified.
    Spring Batch provides a class <classname>AssertFile</classname> to
    facilitate the verification of output files. The method
    <methodname>assertFileEquals</methodname> takes two
    <classname>File</classname> objects (or two
    <classname>Resource</classname> objects) and asserts, line by line, that
    the two files have the same content. Therefore, it is possible to create a
    file with the expected output and to compare it to the actual
    result:</para>

    <programlisting>private static final String EXPECTED_FILE = "src/main/resources/data/input.txt";
private static final String OUTPUT_FILE = "target/test-outputs/output.txt";

AssertFile.assertFileEquals(new FileSystemResource(EXPECTED_FILE), 
                            new FileSystemResource(OUTPUT_FILE));</programlisting>
  </section>

  <section id="mockingDomainObjects">
    <title>Mocking Domain Objects</title>

    <para>Another common issue encountered while writing unit and integration
    tests for Spring Batch components is how to mock domain objects. A good
    example is a <classname>StepExecutionListener</classname>, as illustrated
    below:</para>

    <programlisting>public class NoWorkFoundStepExecutionListener extends StepExecutionListenerSupport {

    public ExitStatus afterStep(StepExecution stepExecution) {  
        if (stepExecution.getReadCount() == 0) {
            throw new NoWorkFoundException("Step has not processed any items");
        }
        return stepExecution.getExitStatus();
    }
}</programlisting>

    <para>The above listener is provided by the framework and checks a
    <classname>StepExecution</classname> for an empty read count, thus
    signifying that no work was done. While this example is fairly simple, it
    serves to illustrate the types of problems that may be encountered when
    attempting to unit test classes that implement interfaces requiring Spring
    Batch domain objects. Consider the above listener's unit test:</para>

    <programlisting>private NoWorkFoundStepExecutionListener tested = new NoWorkFoundStepExecutionListener();

@Test
public void testAfterStep() {
    <emphasis role="bold">StepExecution stepExecution = new StepExecution("NoProcessingStep",
                new JobExecution(new JobInstance(1L, new JobParameters(), 
                                 "NoProcessingJob")));</emphasis>

    stepExecution.setReadCount(0);

    try {
        tested.afterStep(stepExecution);
        fail();
    } catch (NoWorkFoundException e) {
        assertEquals("Step has not processed any items", e.getMessage());
    }
}</programlisting>

    <para>Because the Spring Batch domain model follows good object orientated
    principles, the StepExecution requires a
    <classname>JobExecution</classname>, which requires a
    <classname>JobInstance</classname> and
    <classname>JobParameters</classname> in order to create a valid
    <classname>StepExecution</classname>. While this is good in a solid domain
    model, it does make creating stub objects for unit testing verbose. To
    address this issue, the Spring Batch test module includes a factory for
    creating domain objects: <classname>MetaDataInstanceFactory</classname>.
    Given this factory, the unit test can be updated to be more
    concise:</para>

    <programlisting>private NoWorkFoundStepExecutionListener tested = new NoWorkFoundStepExecutionListener();

@Test
public void testAfterStep() {
    <emphasis role="bold">StepExecution stepExecution = MetaDataInstanceFactory.createStepExecution();</emphasis>

    stepExecution.setReadCount(0);

    try {
        tested.afterStep(stepExecution);
        fail();
    } catch (NoWorkFoundException e) {
        assertEquals("Step has not processed any items", e.getMessage());
    }
}</programlisting>

    <para>The above method for creating a simple
    <classname>StepExecution</classname> is just one convenience method
    available within the factory. A full method listing can be found in its
    <ulink
    url="http://static.springframework.org/spring-batch/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/test/MetaDataInstanceFactory.html">Javadoc</ulink>.</para>
