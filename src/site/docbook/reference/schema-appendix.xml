  <title>Meta-Data Schema</title>

  <section id="metaDataSchemaOverview">
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>The Spring Batch Meta-Data tables very closely match the Domain
    objects that represent them in Java. For example,
    <classname>JobInstance</classname>, <classname>JobExecution</classname>,
    <classname>JobParameters</classname>, and
    <classname>StepExecution</classname> map to BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE,
    BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION, BATCH_JOB_PARAMS, and BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION,
    respectively. <classname>ExecutionContext</classname> maps to both
    BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_CONTEXT and BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_CONTEXT. The
    <classname>JobRepository</classname> is responsible for saving and storing
    each Java object into its correct table. The following appendix describes
    the meta-data tables in detail, along with many of the design decisions
    that were made when creating them. When viewing the various table creation
    statements below, it is important to realize that the data types used are
    as generic as possible. Spring Batch provides many schemas as examples,
    which all have varying data types due to variations in individual database
    vendors' handling of data types. Below is an ERD model of all 6 tables and
    their relationships to one another:</para>

    <section id="exampleDDLScripts">
      <title>Example DDL Scripts</title>

      <para>The Spring Batch Core JAR file contains example
      scripts to create the relational tables for a number of database
      platforms (which are in turn auto-detected by the job repository factory
      bean or namespace equivalent). These scripts can be used as is, or
      modified with additional indexes and constraints as desired. The file
      names are in the form <literal>schema-*.sql</literal>, where "*" is the
      short name of the target database platform.  The scripts are in
	  the package <literal>org.springframework.batch.core</literal>.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="metaDataVersion">
      <title>Version</title>

      <para>Many of the database tables discussed in this appendix contain a
      version column. This column is important because Spring Batch employs an
      optimistic locking strategy when dealing with updates to the database.
      This means that each time a record is 'touched' (updated) the value in
      the version column is incremented by one. When the repository goes back
      to try and save the value, if the version number has change it will
      throw <classname>OptimisticLockingFailureException</classname>,
      indicating there has been an error with concurrent access. This check is
      necessary since, even though different batch jobs may be running in
      different machines, they are all using the same database tables.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="metaDataIdentity">
      <title>Identity</title>

      <para>BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE, BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION, and BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION
      each contain columns ending in _ID. These fields act as primary keys for
      their respective tables. However, they are not database generated keys,
      but rather they are generated by separate sequences. This is necessary
      because after inserting one of the domain objects into the database, the
      key it is given needs to be set on the actual object so that they can be
      uniquely identified in Java. Newer database drivers (Jdbc 3.0 and up)
      support this feature with database generated keys, but rather than
      requiring it, sequences were used. Each variation of the schema will
      contain some form of the following:</para>

      <programlisting>CREATE SEQUENCE BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_SEQ;
CREATE SEQUENCE BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_SEQ;
CREATE SEQUENCE BATCH_JOB_SEQ;</programlisting>

      <para>Many database vendors don't support sequences. In these cases,
      work-arounds are used, such as the following for mySQL:</para>

      <programlisting>CREATE TABLE BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_SEQ (ID BIGINT NOT NULL) type=MYISAM;
INSERT INTO BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION_SEQ values(0);
CREATE TABLE BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_SEQ (ID BIGINT NOT NULL) type=MYISAM;
INSERT INTO BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION_SEQ values(0);
CREATE TABLE BATCH_JOB_SEQ (ID BIGINT NOT NULL) type=MYISAM;
INSERT INTO BATCH_JOB_SEQ values(0);</programlisting>

      <para>In the above case, a table is used in place of each sequence. The
      Spring core class <classname>MySQLMaxValueIncrementer</classname> will
      then increment the one column in this sequence in order to give similar
      functionality.</para>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="metaDataBatchJobInstance">
    <title>BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE</title>

    <para>The BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE table holds all information relevant to a
    <classname>JobInstance</classname>, and serves as the top of the overall
    hierarchy. The following generic DDL statement is used to create
    it:</para>

    <programlisting>CREATE TABLE BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE  (
  JOB_INSTANCE_ID BIGINT  PRIMARY KEY ,  
  VERSION BIGINT,  
  JOB_NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL , 
  JOB_KEY VARCHAR(2500)
);</programlisting>

    <para>Below are descriptions of each column in the table:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_INSTANCE_ID: The unique id that will identify the instance,
        which is also the primary key. The value of this column should be
        obtainable by calling the <methodname>getId</methodname> method on
        <classname>JobInstance</classname>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>VERSION: See above section.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_NAME: Name of the job obtained from the
        <classname>Job</classname> object. Because it is required to identify
        the instance, it must not be null.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_KEY: A serialization of the
        <classname>JobParameters</classname> that uniquely identifies separate
        instances of the same job from one another.
        (<classname>JobInstances</classname> with the same job name must have
        different <classname>JobParameters</classname>, and thus, different
        JOB_KEY values).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section id="metaDataBatchJobParams">
    <title>BATCH_JOB_PARAMS</title>

    <para>The BATCH_JOB_PARAMS table holds all information relevant to the
    <classname>JobParameters</classname> object. It contains 0 or more
    key/value pairs that together uniquely identify a
    <classname>JobInstance</classname> and serve as a record of the parameters
    a job was run with. It should be noted that the table has been
    denormalized. Rather than creating a separate table for each type, there
    is one table with a column indicating the type:</para>

    <programlisting>CREATE TABLE BATCH_JOB_PARAMS  (
  JOB_INSTANCE_ID BIGINT NOT NULL ,
  TYPE_CD VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL ,
  KEY_NAME VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL , 
  STRING_VAL VARCHAR(250) , 
  DATE_VAL TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL,
  LONG_VAL BIGINT ,
  DOUBLE_VAL DOUBLE PRECISION,
  constraint JOB_INSTANCE_PARAMS_FK foreign key (JOB_INSTANCE_ID)
  references BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE(JOB_INSTANCE_ID)
);</programlisting>

    <para>Below are descriptions for each column:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>JOB_INSTANCE_ID: Foreign Key from the BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE table
        that indicates the job instance the parameter entry belongs to. It
        should be noted that multiple rows (i.e key/value pairs) may exist for
        each instance.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>TYPE_CD: String representation of the type of value stored,
        which can be either a string, date, long, or double. Because the type
        must be known, it cannot be null.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>KEY_NAME: The parameter key.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>STRING_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is string.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DATE_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is date.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>LONG_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is a long.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>DOUBLE_VAL: Parameter value, if the type is double.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>It is worth noting that there is no primary key for this table. This
    is simply because the framework has no use for one, and thus doesn't
    require it. If a user so chooses, one may be added with a database
    generated key, without causing any issues to the framework itself.</para>

  <section id="metaDataBatchJobExecution">
    <title>BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION</title>

    <para>The BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION table holds all information relevant to the

    <title>Archiving</title>

    <para>Because there are entries in multiple tables every time a batch job
    is run, it is common to create an archive strategy for the meta-data
    tables. The tables themselves are designed to show a record of what
    happened in the past, and generally won't affect the run of any job, with
    a couple of notable exceptions pertaining to restart:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The framework will use the meta-data tables to determine if a

      <listitem>
        <para>If a job is restarted, the framework will use any data that has

    <para>If you are using multi-byte character sets (e.g. Chines or Cyrillic)
	  in your business processing, then those characters might need to be
	  persisted in the Spring Batch schema.  Many users find that 
	  simply changing the schema to double the length of the <literal>VARCHAR</literal> 
	  columns is enough.  Others prefer to configure the <link
    linkend="configuringJobRepository"><classname>JobRepository</classname></link> with <literal>max-varchar-length</literal> half the value of the <literal>VARCHAR</literal> column length is enough.  Some users have also reported that
	they use <literal>NVARCHAR</literal> in place of <literal>VARCHAR</literal>
	in their schema definitions.  The best result will depend on the database

    <title>Recommendations for Indexing Meta Data Tables</title>

    <para>Spring Batch provides DDL samples for the meta-data tables in the
    Core jar file for several common database platforms. Index declarations
    are not included in that DDL because there are too many variations in how
    users may want to index depending on their precise platform, local
    conventions and also the business requirements of how the jobs will be
    operated. The table below provides some indication as to which columns are
    going to be used in a WHERE clause by the Dao implementations provided by
    Spring Batch, and how frequently they might be used, so that individual
    projects can make up their own minds about indexing.</para>
